At first, a hydrogen bond formation between the oxygen atom of the substrate and the –OH group on the LDH layer occurred (see Fig. 4, A). The less hindered carbon atom of the activated epoxide was attacked by the intercalated iodide anion, allowing the opening of the epoxy ring (Fig. 4, B). Acyclic esters are formed when CO2 is added to the anionic intermediate species (Fig. 4, C). Finally, the catalyst is regenerated following the formation of the cyclic carbonate through an intramolecular nucleophilic attack (Fig. 4, D).

Països Catalans 16, 43,007 Tarragona, Spain. In this work, we prepared a new active heterogeneous, single-component, catalyst (I-(Mg/Al)LDH) for the cycloaddition reaction of CO2 to epoxides. I-LDH was able to catalyze this reaction selectively to cyclic organic carbonates. From a mechanistic point of view, iodide anions within the interlayer and the hydroxide group of the LDH cooperate in the cycloaddition reaction. The reaction conditions (T = 80 °C, 2 MPa of CO2, methyl ethyl ketone as a solvent, PO:I-LDH wt ratio of 1.7, 24 h) were optimized using propylene oxide, with a conversion up to 47% and a total selectivity to the cyclic carbonate and then the study was extended to other commercial epoxides with encouraging results. The reversible I-LDH poisoning due to the absorption of CO2 as unreactive carbonate interlayer anion was also investigated and the catalyst was reactivated by treatment in a concentrated KI aqueous solution.

On the one hand, CO2 has been recognized as a common industrial waste and the primary greenhouse gas emitted through human activities [3]. On the other hand, it is a ubiquitous, nontoxic, economical, and renewable carbon feedstock (C1) [4,5], potentially valuable as a starting material for the synthesis of various organic molecules and advanced materials [6] through reductive and non-reductive coupling chemistry [7,8]. Given that, the high thermodynamic stability of CO2 limits its use as a chemical building-block. One way to add value is by its coupling reaction with high-energy compounds like epoxides to produce or cyclic carbonates (COCs) or aliphatic polycarbonates (APCs) [9,10]. These processes, in which CO2 is incorporated into products without affecting the oxidation state of the carbon center, are highly exothermic and benefit from having a 100% atom economy. In addition, to overcome the CO2 kinetic inertness the use of a catalytic system is required to run the reaction under less harsh conditions. The product divergence in COCs and APCs could be easily tuned by many factors, such as the type of catalysts, the reaction conditions, and the nature of substrates [11–13]. In particular for the obtaining of COCs, a large number of homogeneous catalysts (e.g., ionic liquids [14], organocatalysts [15], and metal complexes [16–18]) have been developed in recent decades for the cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides. Among the most studied the binary catalytic systems formed by a Lewis acid (metal center) with a halide anion X − (nucleophiles) have been shown high performance for this target reaction [13,19,20]. Many metal-based complexes of the main group elements (Al, Mg, and Ca) and transition metals (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Zn) in combination with ammonium or phosphonium salts have been investigated [21–27]. The artificial fixation of CO2 via COCs synthesis is one of the most promising processes of CO2 transformation and successive utilization [28–30], because the five-membered cyclic carbonates products have a wide range of applications as electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries [31,32], green polar aprotic solvents [33,34], organic intermediates [35,36], precursors for polymer synthesis [37,38], and fine chemicals [39]. Despite the high efficiency of homogeneous catalytic systems, the issues of product separation and catalyst reusability remains major challenges in the field limiting their industrial applications. In consideration of these, in the last years, various heterogeneous catalysts for the CO2 chemical conversion have been developed including porous organic polymers (POPs) [40], metal halide systems [41,42], metal-oxides, metal-organic framework (MOF) [43,44], zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) materials [45], single-atom catalysts (SACs) [46] and metal-free nitrogen-doped carbon catalysts obtained from chitosan, chitin, shrimp shell wastes [47]. However, in some cases, these systems require harsh reaction conditions limiting their performances and substrate scope [48]. Furthermore, to catalyze the reaction efficiently, the addition of external nucleophilic anions was often required. Therefore, in this field, the search for efficient heterogeneous catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity is in continuous development [49,50]. Layered double hydroxide (LDH) is a class of multi‐metal lamellar materials represented by the formula [MII 1-xMIII x(OH)2] x +(Ay−)x/y•zH2O, with divalent (MII) and trivalent (MIII) metallic cations, and charge compensating anions (Ay−) that can be readily replaced in the interlayer regions [51]. Due to their tunable chemistry and high charge density, LDH has attracted considerable interest for applications in various fields, including drug delivery [52], fire-retardant systems [53], anion exchange materials [54], photochemistry [55], and catalysts [56]. Since LDH has Lewis acid and base sites able to activate epoxides and CO2 adsorption, they are promising materials, easy and inexpensive to synthesize, for CO2 capture and its transformation. In literature, only limited examples of LDH used as heterogeneous catalysts for the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides have been reported yet. According to Kuwahara et al., a Ca-based LDH can act as a solid catalyst in the cycloaddition reaction of styrene oxide (SO) with an atmospheric pressure of CO2 (yield = 98%, selectivity = 90%), but the catalytic performance depends strongly on the calcination temperature (600 °C) and the solvent used (DMF) [57]. Sun et al. tested ZnAl-LDH in the presence of tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) as a cocatalyst for the CO2 coupling with propylene oxide (PO), obtaining the corresponding cyclic carbonate, propylene carbonate (PC) (yield = 96%), under very mild conditions (12 h, 25 °C, and PCO2 = 1 Mpa) [58]. A yield and selectivity greater than 90% of PO were exhibited by a Br-LDH without any co-catalyst reported by Liu and Han [59]. The performance in terms of catalysis has been attributed to the unique character of the material, in which bromide and hydroxyl are simultaneously present and cooperate in the CO2/epoxide coupling. Recently, MgFeAl trimetallic LDH was prepared by Ahn and coworkers using recycled industrial solid wastes (red mud and ferronickel slag) [60]. By using TBAB as a co-catalyst, MgFeAl-LDH was active for solvent-free CO2 cycloaddition to various epoxides (epichlorohydrin (ECH) and other epoxides such as cyclohexene oxide (CHO), PO, and SO), showing high selectivity towards the cyclic carbonate products. In this paper, a series of LDHs was synthesized by hydrothermal method [61], starting from MgO and Al(OH)3, and tested as heterogeneous catalysts in CO2/epoxides reactions. LDHs were prepared by changing mole ratios of metal cations (Mg/Al) and interlayer anions (OH −, CO 3 2−, Cl −, Br −, I −) to investigate their effect on catalysis. The catalyst LDH with intercalated iodide was employed as single-component catalyst (characterized by a surface area of 34.5 m2/g, 2.5 wt.% iodine, and Mg/Al ratio of 3) exhibiting the best catalytic performance. Indeed, it showed a 41% conversion with a selectivity >99% in the CO2 cycloaddition to propylene oxide, using methylethylketone (MEK) as solvent at 80 °C (2 MPa P co2, 24 h). To date, it is the first time that I-LDH was employed as a catalyst for the conversion of CO2 with epoxides to COCs. The study was extended to different epoxides such as glycidol(GLY), ECH, SO, CHO, hexene oxide (HO), and allyl glycidyl ether (AGE). Finally, the recyclability of the catalyst under operating conditions was evaluated. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials Magnesium oxide (98%), sodium hydrogen carbonate (99.7%), sodium chloride (> 99%), potassium bromide (> 99%) and potassium iodide (> 99%), mesitylene, deuterated chloroform, propylene oxide, glycidol, epichlorohydrin, styrene oxide, hexene oxide, cyclohexene oxide and allyl glycidyl ether were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. The methyl ethyl ketone and the sodium hydroxide (97.5%) were obtained from Carlo Erba Reagents. CO2 (100% purity) was purchased from RIVOIRA gas. Before being used in the catalysis reactions, MEK and all the used epoxides were preliminary purified by distillation under nitrogen flow on calcium hydride for 24 h. 2.2 LDHs preparation LDH samples, with OH− and CO3 2− as interlayer anion and an Mg/Al molar ratio of 1.5 (LDH-1) and 3 (LDH-3) respectively, were synthesized by the hydrothermal method following the procedure reported by Liao et al. [61]. In detail, MgO was introduced into a beaker and left under stirring for 30 min. Subsequently, a proper amount of Al(OH)3, obtained as a value-added product from waste produced within the aluminum industry, NaOH and the NaHCO3 were added to the mixture (see Table S1 for major detail). The mixture was left under magnetic stirring for 5 min and then put on an autoclave for 40 h at 120 °C. Then the autoclave was allowed to cool to room temperature naturally. The resulting suspensions were centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 rpm, and the precipitates were washed with distilled water and dried in an oven at 100 °C for 8 h. 2.3 Preparation of X (Cl−, Br−, I−)-LDH by anion exchange method X-LDH where X are Cl−, Br− and I−, were prepared through the anion exchange method where the OH anion in the interlayer was exchanged by the halide anion [62]. The anion exchange reaction is carried out by placing 1.5 g of OH-LDH in 50 mL of the 12 wt% solution of NaCl, KBr and KI under continuous stirring for 1 h. Then the solid is washed with deionized water and placed in an oven at 100 °C for 8 h. 2.4 Catalysts characterization The X-RD patterns of LDHs were obtained with a Bruker D8 Advance automatic diffractometer operating with a CuKα (λ =1.54 Å) radiation filtered with nickel. The determination of the Mg / Al molar ratios was carried out by ICP-OES analyses using a Bruker Optima 7000 instrumentation with s10 automatic sampler operating continuously. LDHs with a Mg/Al molar ratio equal to 1.5 and 3.4 were described as LDH1 and LDH3 respectively. The CO3 2- content, due to the CO2 adsorption during the synthesis, storage and use in catalytic reactions of the prepared LDHs was determined by means of elemental analysis using a Thermo CHNS / O EA 1112 instrument. The operating used conditions were: oven temperature 65 °C, furnace temperature 950 °C, helium flow as carrier set at 140 mL min−1 and oxygen flow at 100 mL min−1. The catalysts surface area was measured with an ASAP 2010 instrument (Micromeritics) using the BET method (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller theory) for nitrogen adsorption isotherms at −196 °C. Using scanning electron spectroscopy, the%wt of the anions Cl−and I − in LDH's interlayers was determined. The morphological and elementary analyzes were performed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Tescan Vega LMU) equipped with X-ray energy dispersion microanalysis of elements with atomic number N4, with a resolution of MnKα lower than 123 eV (100,000 cps) (EDX, Bruker Quantax 800). In samples containing both Al and Br, it was not possible to quantify Br by EDX due to the overlap of the Kα signal of Br and Al. The interlayer Br− was measured by ion chromatography with a ThermoFisher Aquion instrument equipped with an Aquion IonPac-4 μm (4 × 50 mm) column and using 8 × 10−3 M Na2CO3/ 1 × 10−3 M NaHCO3 solution as eluent at a constant flow of 1.20 mL min−1 using a conductivity detector. The interlayer anion was preliminary extracted from the LDH using the eluent solution of Na2CO3/NaHCO3. 1H NMR spectra of the obtained products were recorded with Bruker spectrometers (300 and 400 MHz). The chemical shifts were reported to TMS and calculated using the residual isotopic impurities of the deuterated solvent (CDCl3: 7.26 ppm in 1H NMR). 2.5 CO2 conversion to COCs: experimental setup All reactions were carried out using 60 mL stainless steel autoclaves (surface area/volume ratio of the stainless-steel cylindrical reactor (90 cm2, 60 ml)), where a 20 mL vial loaded with 500 mg of X-LDH is placed (X: OH−, CO3 2−, Cl−, Br−, I −). The reactor is left under a flow of CO2 (about 0.1 MPa) for 5 min. Then, keeping the CO2 flow at 0.1 MPa, 5 mL of MEK and 0.0143 mol of epoxide were added. The reactor is charged with 2 MPa of CO2, placed in an oil bath heated to 80 °C for 24 h. Subsequently the reactor was cooled in an ice bath for about 20 min and depressurized. The reaction product is recovered by filtration and washing with acetone. Then to recover the sole product the solvent was removed by means of a rotary evaporator. The reaction yield and the selectivity into cyclic carbonate, considering the initial amount of epoxide, is calculated through 1H NMR by adding 1.43 × 10−3 mol of mesitylene, used as internal standard. The conversion is calculated as the ratio between yield and selectivity. The reaction conditions were initially optimized in terms of temperature, time, pressure and catalyst loading in the presence of PO. The study is subsequently extended to other epoxides such as: glycidol, epichlorohydrin, styrene oxide, cyclohexene oxide, hexene oxide and allyl glycidyl ether to enlarge the reaction scope. 2.6 Catalyst recyclability and reactivation Catalyst recyclability experiments were carried out for I-LDH to evaluate its potential reuse for several reaction cycles. After the completion of the reaction, the catalyst was recovered by filtration, washed with acetone and then dried at 100 °C for 1 hour before being reused for a new reaction cycle. The reactivation of the I-LDH catalyst is carried out by placing the recovered catalyst in 50 mL of a 12% wt solution of KI for one hour under continuous stirring. The catalyst was then filtered, washed with distilled water and, finally, treated in an oven at 100 °C for 8 h. 3 Results and discussion The preparation of X (Cl−, Br− and I −)-LDH was carried out by anion exchange method starting from OH-LDH. Furthermore, to enlarge the evaluation of the effect of the interlayer anion on catalysis, CO3 2− -LDH was also synthesized. XRD patterns of the above-mentioned materials were showed in Fig. 1 . The typical crystal plane ((003), (006), (009), (015), (018), (110) ed (113)) of an LDH were recorded at 2θ values of 11.7, 23.1, 34.9, 39.4, 46.4, 60.7 e 62.2 respectively and are indicated by arrows in Fig. 1. and Fig. 2 . Furthermore, brucite (Mg(OH)2) impurities (indicated by red asterisks) were found due to the synthetic procedure which involves the use of MgO. In addition, XRD patterns of X-LDH were reported in Fig. 2. As clearly shown, the characteristic signals of the LDH were retained and a shift at lower 2θ values was observed for the (003) crystal plane in the presence of both Br− and I − due to the intercalated anion dimension. Catalysts were characterized also in terms of the surface area using a nitrogen adsorption-desorption method. Results were summarized in Table S2 and the BET surface areas were in the range of 23–35 m2 g − 1. The homogeneous distribution of chloride (1.5–2.0 wt%) and iodide (2.5–5.7 wt%) anions and the metal cations are determined by SEM-EDX analyses. 40 Spectra were measured on each powder and the standard deviation of the measurements was between 0,5 and 1% showing a good distribution of the interested elements in the powder. Characteristic EDX spectra of OH-LDH, Br-LDH, I-LDH, Cl-LDH were reported in the supporting material. Bromide concentrations, on the base of the Al interference using SEM-EDX, were determined through ion chromatography and it was in the range of 2.0–3.3 wt%. The carbonate content in all the analyzed samples was lower than 1 wt% apart from the LDHCO3 2− which was characterized by a carbonate amount of 2.76 wt% (major detail were reported in Table S3). The cycloaddition of CO2 to propylene oxide was chosen as model reaction and investigated in the presence of various LDHs at 80 °C and 2 MPa of CO2. Results were summarized in Table 1 . The best catalytic performance is observed in the presence of I-LDH with the conversion into cyclic carbonate and the selectivity up to 20% and >99% respectively (Table 1, entries 4 and 9), regardless of the interlayer anions amount (Table S2) and the Mg/Al molar ratios which has shown to play a crucial role in the cycloaddition reaction of CO2 to epoxides in the presence of mixed oxides as catalysts [63]. For the LDH containing intercalated halide ions (Table 1, entries 2–4 and 7–9), catalytic activities follow the order of I − > Br− > Cl−, reasonably due to the relative nucleophilicity and basicity of halogen anions ant their behavior as leaving group (see the reaction mechanism proposed in Fig. 4). Indeed, Br-LDH exhibited a maximum conversion of 13% (Table 1, entry 8), while in the case of Cl-LDH the conversion was significantly lower, less than 1% (Table 1, entries 2 and 7). Notably, the desired product was not detectable with CO3 2−-LDH and OH-LDH. In the latter case, a mixture of hardly identifiable products was recognized and further studies will be carried out to describe the reaction pathways and the obtained products. The presence of hydroxyl group as both nucleophile and leaving group could represents a limitation also in the light of the reaction mechanism proposed in Fig. 4. Once the most performing catalytic system (I-LDH) was found, the effect of the use of a solvent (5 ml), such as methyl-ethyl-ketone (MEK) able to effectively solubilize CO2 [64], on catalysis with respect to neat conditions was evaluated. MEK is a promising solvent, widely used in industrial processes involving resins, gums, nitrocellulose coatings, varnishes, and in vinyl films [65]. Compared to the result reported in Table 1 (entry 9), the conversion to cyclic carbonate with I-LDH(3) using MEK as solvent increases from 20% to 41%. The presence of MEK plays an important role, increasing the solubility and favoring the adsorption of CO2 in the interlayers of the I-LDH(3) and, consequently, promoting the CO2/epoxide cycloaddition reaction. Given the improvement in conversion, all subsequent experiments were conducted in the presence of MEK. To optimize the reaction conditions, we also studied the major influencing factors (temperature, pressure, time, and catalyst loading) on the catalytic activity. The results are shown in Fig. 3 . It was found that there was a considerable increase in the conversion (from 1% to 41%) when the temperature was increased from room temperature to 80 °C. No data were recorded at higher temperatures due to the MEK boiling point (79.6 °C at 0.1 MPa). The CO2 pressure is another critical parameter to optimize the catalytic activity with a maximum detected at 2 MPa. Then we determined the time profiles of the reaction as shown in Fig. 3 (bottom left), observing an increment in conversion over time up to 41% after 48 h. Finally, the effect of catalyst loading was evaluated by varying the PO/I-LDH(3) weight ratio and finding the maximum conversion for values between 1.3 and 1.6. Therefore, the above-mentioned optimized conditions for the CO2/PO coupling reaction, catalyzed by I-LDH(3), were found to be: 14.3 mmol of epoxide (0.83 g), 0.500 g of catalyst (PO/I-LDH(3) = 1.66), 5 mL of MEK, P(CO2) = 2 MPa, 24 h, and 80 °C. The performance of the heterogeneous catalyst I-LDH has been attributed to its unique structure, in which the nucleophilic iodide and the hydroxyl group were combined into a single material and act synergistically in catalyzing the reaction. Based on the experimental results of this study, and the related knowledge in the literature [59], a possible mechanism for CO2/epoxides coupling over I-LDH is proposed in Fig. 4 . In order to explore the versatility of the I-LDH (3), the cycloaddition reactions of CO2 with a several epoxides (GLY, ECH, SO, HO, AGE, and CHO) were also investigated under the optimized reaction conditions (see Table 2 ). For all examined substrates, except for CHO (Table 2, entry 6), cyclic organic carbonates were formed with total selectivity. In the case of GLY, obtainable from the glycerol biorefinery [66,67], the highest conversion (48%) was recorded (Table 1, entry 1). Given the high selectivity (>99%), this result is particularly attractive because generally, at 80 °C, the main byproducts are glycidol oligomerization products formed via epoxide ring-opening at both acidic and basic conditions [68–70]. In general, considering the substrates, the reactivity of the epoxides strongly depended on the substituted R group. When the R group was electron-withdrawing chloromethyl (Table 2, entry 2), a significant decrease in conversion (20%) is observed, as well as for SO (13%; Table 2, entry 3) due to steric hindrance of the phenyl ring, which limits its diffusion into the interlayer region of LDH catalyst. Conversions of about 30% were achieved with HO and AGE, while the CHO provided only trace cycloaddition products due to its lower chemical reactivity respect to terminal epoxides. The carbon balance, calculated by dividing the sum of the carbon atoms detected in the reaction mixture by the sum of the carbon atoms of the reagents fed, is in all cases higher than 95%. Sheldon test [71] is performed to verify real heterogeneity of I-LDH catalyst for the cycloaddition reaction of CO2 to glycidol. Thus, the reaction mixture after 12 h at 80 °C is filtered and the filtrate is further heated at 80 °C for an additional 12 h. Results clearly show that catalytic activity dropped down when the catalyst was removed from the reaction mixture (glycerol carbonate yield of 20% after 12 h and 20% after 24 h). The recyclability of I-LDH (3) was investigated in the cycloaddition of CO2 to PO under the optimized reaction conditions (T = 80 °C, 24 h, 10 mL of MEK, PCO2=2 MPa, 1 ml PO, 500 mg I-LDH (3) (wt PO/wt I-LDH(3)=1.66 this ratio was maintained for the next runs). After the reaction, the catalyst was recovered by filtration and dried at 100 °C for 1 h before being reused in the next run. The catalytic activity of I-LDH (3) decreased from 47% (first run) to 19% (second run) and 12% (third run) maintaining a total selectivity to the desired product such propylene carbonate. The reduction in terms of catalytic activity can be attributed to the crystallinity reduction as highlighted in Fig. S1 which can influence the coordination of PO and CO2 within the interlayer. The latter was a consequence of the thermal and mechanic treatment to which the I-LDH (3) is subjected. Furthermore, the activity was also influenced by the substitution of the reactive iodide anion within the interlayer with unreactive carbonate (I −=2.5 wt% in the fresh catalyst and 0.17 wt% after three runs; CO3 2−=<LOD in the fresh catalyst and 2.8 wt% after three consecutive runs). The loss of iodide into the reaction mixture represents a source of a homogeneous catalyst (i.e. iodide anion) which is able to promote the cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxide [72]. Considering the elemental analyses and the SEM-EDX characterization on the recycled catalyst we excluded the presence of organic molecules (i.e. aliphatic polycarbonates oligomers) over the catalyst surface or inside the porosity of I-LDH. Starting from these observations, the catalyst was reactivated by treatment in 12 wt% KI aqueous solution for 1 h, washed with distilled water, dried at 100 °C for 1 h and then reused in the next run. The conversion increased up to 20% due to the raise of the I − concentration (2.2 wt% after the reactivation) and crystallinity (see Fig. S2). This result highlighted the reversible catalyst poisoning due to the CO2 adsorption in form of carbonate within the LDH interlayer which can be overcome with the treatment in KI solution. The proposed approach is also in line with the results reported by Pescarmona in the presence of iodide-functionalized IRA-910 and IRA-910 heterogenous catalysts where the treatment in KI solution is recommended after each reaction cycle [73]. 4 Conclusions In summary, a family of X (Cl−, Br−, I −)-LDH was synthesized, characterized and used as single-component catalysts in the cycloaddition reaction of CO2 to epoxides. The best results in terms of conversion and selectivity to cyclic organic carbonates were obtained using I-LDH which was a new and recyclable heterogeneous catalyst for this scope. I-LDH showed good performances in the conversion of PO to propylene carbonate (47% of conversion and total selectivity) under the optimized reaction conditions (80 °C, 24 h, 2 MPa of CO2). I-LDH was also active in the cycloaddition of CO2 to several commercial epoxides forming selectively COCs without any co-catalyst (i.e. TBAB) in the presence of nontoxic methyl ethyl ketone as solvent. I-LDH catalyzed the cycloaddition reaction through the cooperation of the interlayer iodide and the hydroxyl groups and open the way to future improvements about this class of fully heterogeneous catalysts in this research field.

        "dc:description": "In this work, we prepared a new active heterogeneous, single-component, catalyst (I-(Mg/Al)LDH) for the cycloaddition reaction of CO2 to epoxides. I-LDH was able to catalyze this reaction selectively to cyclic organic carbonates. From a mechanistic point of view, iodide anions within the interlayer and the hydroxide group of the LDH cooperate in the cycloaddition reaction. The reaction conditions (T = 80 °C, 2 MPa of CO2, methyl ethyl ketone as a solvent, PO:I-LDH wt ratio of 1.7, 24 h) were optimized using propylene oxide, with a conversion up to 47% and a total selectivity to the cyclic carbonate and then the study was extended to other commercial epoxides with encouraging results. The reversible I-LDH poisoning due to the absorption of CO2 as unreactive carbonate interlayer anion was also investigated and the catalyst was reactivated by treatment in a concentrated KI aqueous solution.",
