Graphical abstract The abundant oxygen-containing functional groups in O,N-CC can coordinate with Zn ions and guide their transmission pathways, while the N heteroatoms provide rich active sites for Zn ions deposition. The society’s urgent demand for environmentally friendly, safe and low-cost energy storage devices has promoted the research of aqueous zinc-ion batteries. However, the uneven deposition of Zn ions on anodes will lead to the growth of the dendrite and reduce the Coulombic efficiency as well as the lifespan of the devices. Herein, we construct an O,N-dual functionalized carbon cloth current collector via a simple hydrothermal strategy, in which the oxygen-containing functional groups and the N heteroatoms can regulate the transmission and deposition of Zn ions, respectively. The proposed synergistic strategy ensures the uniform distribution of Zn ions on the surface of the Zn anode and inhibits the formation of dendrites. The symmetric cell based on the O,N-dual doped carbon cloth presents superior cycling stability (318 h) with a low voltage hysteresis (11.2 mV) at an areal capacity of 1 mAh cm−2 (20% depth of diacharge). Meanwhile, the appreciably low overpotential (16 mV) and high Columbic efficiency (98.2%) also demonstrate that the O,N-dual functionalized carbon cloth can be worked as a promising host for Zn ions deposition. Keywords O,N-dual functionalized carbon cloth Synergistic strategy Long cycle life Low overpotential Dendrite-free Zn anode 1 Introduction With the development of electrical vehicles, grid energy storage systems and portable devices, it is urgently demanded to develop an environmentally friendly energy storage system with high energy density and long lifespan [1–4]. Among various energy storage devices, rechargeable aqueous Zn-ion batteries have attracted great interest due to the high theoretical capacity (820 mAh g−1) and low redox potential (−0.762 V vs SHE) of Zn [5,6]. The emergence of Zn-based devices can solve the drawbacks of Li-ion batteries such as high cost, flammable organic electrolyte as well as inadequate lithium resources [7,8]. However, the uneven deposition of Zn ions on the surface of bare Zn anode leads to the formation of dendrites, which may puncture the separators and short-circuit the devices [6,9]. Maximizing the active sites of Zn electrodes is one of the most practical methods to enhance the Zn ions storage capacity. Therefore, the geometry modification of the Zn electrode and the current collector to enlarge the surface area catches particular research attention. For instance, Cu foam [10], Ni foam [11], 3D Mxene [12,13], Cu mesh [14] and 3D porous Ti [15] have been proposed to work as supporters for consistent Zn ions distribution. However, the proposed current collectors are usually too thick, weight, tough or hard to prepare, seriously impeding the energy density and flexibility of the batteries and hindering their further large-scale application. Carbon cloth (CC) has some intrinsic advantages, such as high specific surface area, ultra-lightweight, and an intriguing vertical horizontal network structure, which can open up a new way for the development of Zn metal anodes toward the next generation large-scale energy storage application. The current collectors based on CC are usually treated by electroplating metal nanosheets [16], modifying the MnO2 [17] or in situ growing N doped graphene nanosheets [18] on the surface of CC to enhance the zincophilicity. However, the current collectors based on CC need many steps to synthesis, accompanied by the defects of poor flexibility as well as the increased weight, which reduces the lifespan of the battery. Herein, the O,N-dual functionalized carbon cloth (O,N-CC) current collector was fabricated via a simple hydrothermal method and acted as a host for Zn ions deposition. Firstly, the O,N-CC owns a large surface area, which can provide plentiful nucleation sites for Zn ions and regulate the electric field distribution. The doping treatment changes the chemical composition of the CC, resulting in a low diffusion resistance of electrolyte. In addition, the abundant oxygen-containing functional groups in O,N-CC can coordinate with Zn ions and guide their transmission pathways. Compared with bare CC, the introduced N heteroatoms show higher binding energy with Zn, reducing the nucleation overpotential of Zn ions on O,N-CC. As expected, a high average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 98.2% and low nucleation overpotential (16.7 mV) are obtained based on the O,N-CC current collector, which is superior to the pristine one. Meanwhile, the O,N-CC@Zn electrode demonstrates an improved cycling life up to 318 h at 1 mA cm−2 with a capacity of 1 mAh cm−2, which is much better than most current collectors reported in previous works. More importantly, the Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitor constructed with O,N-CC@Zn anode and activated carbon (AC) cathode shows a high specific capacity up to 185.75F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1. Even at a high current density of 5 A g−1, it can also present 92.1% capacity retention after 10000 cycles, higher than the supercapacitor that builds with the pristine CC (P-CC) current collector. All these results indicate that the synergistic effect between oxygen-containing functional groups and N heteroatoms ensures the homogenous transmission, nucleation, and deposition of Zn ions. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Carbon cloth was purchased from HeSen Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Nitric acid and sulfuric acid were purchased from Luoyang chemical reagent factory. Zinc sulfate heptahydrate (ZnSO4∙7H2O) and the AC were purchased from Aladdin. All the reagents were used without further purification. 2.2 Preparation of O,N-CC The O,N-CC was synthesized via a simple hydrothermal strategy. Typically, the P-CC was cleaned with acetone, ethanol and deionized water in sequence. Then, the cleaned CC was immersed in a mixture containing 20 mL of concentrated HNO3 and 20 mL of concentrated H2SO4 at 60 °C. After keeping for 2.5 h, the obtained CC was cleaned with distilled water and dried at 60 °C to obtain the oxidized CC (O-CC). Subsequently, the O-CC was placed in a Teflon-lined autoclave container, which contained 1 mL of 25 wt% ammonium hydroxide and 10 mL of distilled water. The container was heated at 120 °C for 12 h. The collected samples were cleaned with distilled water and then dried at 60 °C to obtain the O,N-CC. 2.3 Preparation of P-CC@Zn, O-CC@Zn and O,N-CC@Zn electrodes The P-CC@Zn was fabricated by a facile electrochemical deposition approach on LAND-CT2001A battery-testing instrument. 2 M ZnSO4 was used as electrolyte. The electroplating process was conducted in CR2032 coin cells with disc-shaped Zn and P-CC as anode and cathode, respectively. Metallic Zn was electrodeposited on the P-CC at a current density of 5 mA cm−2 with a fixed capacity of 5 mAh cm−2. After that, the cell was disassembled to obtain the P-CC@Zn electrode. The O-CC@Zn and O,N-CC@Zn electrodes were prepared via the same procedure above. 2.4 Preparation of AC cathode The AC cathode was prepared by mixing AC powder, polyvinylidene fluoride and acetylene black evenly in a weight ratio of 8:1:1 by 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone. Then, the slurry was coated on the stainless steel mesh and dried at 60 °C for 12 h. The mass loading of AC is about 2 mg cm−2. 2.5 Material characterizations The morphology was respected by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Zeiss Sigma 500) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) detector. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on VG scientific ESCALAB250 instrument with an Al K α (300 W) X-ray source. X-ray diffraction spectrometry (XRD) was recorded on Rigaku MiniFlex600 diffractometer using Cu K α radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) at 30 kV to estimate the crystal structure of products. 2.6 Electrochemical measurement Symmetric cells were employed to evaluate the cycling stability of the Zn anodes with different current collectors. The coin cell was composed of P-CC@Zn or O,N-CC@Zn working electrode, glass fiber separator, and Zn foil counter electrode. Besides, the CE of different current collectors were examined in asymmetric cells. 1, 3, 5 mAh cm−2 of Zn were plated on different current collectors at the current densities of 1, 3, 5 mA cm−2, respectively, followed by Zn stripping up to 0.5 V. The full devices with AC cathode and Zn anode with different current collectors were also assembled. The electrochemical properties (including the specific capacity, nucleation overpotential, CE, rate and cycling performance) were measured on LAND-CT2001A battery-testing instrument. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of symmetric cell and the cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) of the full devices were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660E). The electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of P-CC and O,N-CC were tested on CHI 660E electrochemical workstation with a three-electrode system (counter electrode: Pt foil; reference electrode: Ag/AgCl; working electrode: P-CC or O,N-CC; electrolyte: 2 M ZnSO4). The ECSA-referred CV curves were performed at the potential of −50 mV to 50 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl) [19]. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterizations of CC The O,N-CC was fabricated via a simple acidification and hydrothermal doping process (Fig. 1 a). The surface morphology of the various current collectors was evaluated by SEM. As shown in Fig. 1(b and c), both the P-CC and O,N-CC have smooth surfaces, indicating that the chemical treatment does not change the surface structure of the CC. The relatively low temperature will not change the arrangement and structure of the inner atom of CC, so the modification cannot affect the service life of the CC [20,21]. SEM-EDS element mapping was used to prove the successful doping of the O and N. As shown in Fig. 1(d), C, N and O elements are evenly distributed on the surface of O,N-CC. The surface composition chemical state and functional groups of the samples were evaluated by XPS (Fig. 1e). As for the P-CC, there is no obvious peak for N, and a small peak for O is present. The content of the O element in P-CC is 4.89%, while it increases to 11.54% after chemical oxidization, indicating that acidification is an effective strategy to oxidize CC (Fig. S1). There is also a trace amount of N in the O-CC samples, which may be caused by the residual HNO3. Compared with O-CC, the atomic ratio of N in O,N-CC increases from 1.9% to 6.14%, and the O decreases from 11.54% to 7.95%, which can be attributed to the reduction and doping of the oxidized carbon structures are implemented together through the hydrothermal step in aqueous ammonium hydroxide environment. The content of the O element in O,N-CC is also higher than that in P-CC, manifesting abundant oxygen-containing functional groups in O,N-CC, which will regulate the transmission of Zn ions on the electrode surface. Higher N content suggests abundant defect sites, which will provide rich locations for Zn ions deposition due to the high binding energy between N atoms and Zn [22]. 3.2 Electrochemical property evaluation To evaluate the performance of the proposed current collector, the nucleation overpotential of Zn ions on P-CC and O,N-CC were measured with Zn foils as the counter electrodes at various current densities. Nucleation overpotential reveals the thermodynamic consumption of the critical atomic cluster. The nucleation overpotential can be calculated by the difference between the tip potential and the subsequent stable potential [5,18]. As shown in Fig. 2 (a), for P-CC, a sharp voltage drops to −70 mV is observed at beginning of the Zn plating process and then the voltage stabilizes at −33.5 mV at a deposition current density of 1 mA cm−2. The nucleation overpotential is calculated to 36.5 mV for P-CC. In contrast, the O,N-CC shows a lower overpotential of 16.7 mV, indicating a lower Zn nucleation barrier with O and N doping. The abundant oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of O,N-CC can provide fast pathways for ion diffusion, realizing uniform Zn ions distribution at the interface. Zincphilic N heteroatoms provide deposition sites for Zn ions, guaranteeing a balanced electric field at the interface. The nucleation overpotential of Zn deposition on different substrates increases spontaneously with the current density, while the O,N-CC presents lower overpotential for Zn nucleation than P-CC does under all different current densities (Fig. S2). The cycling stability of Zn plating/stripping on various current collectors were also investigated. Herein, the CE is calculated based on the ratio of Zn stripping and plating capacity in each cycle. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the O,N-CC exhibits a higher CE than the P-CC at a current density of 1 mA cm−2. When the current density increases to 3 mA cm−2, the O,N-CC delivers an average CE of about 98.7% after the first two cycles, outperforming the P-CC counterpart (95.7%). Even at a high current density of 10 mA cm−2, the O,N-CC also exhibits higher CE and longer cycle life (Fig. S3). The stable and high CE of the O,N-CC current collector reveals the improved reversibility of Zndeposition. The charge/discharge voltage profiles for 50 cycles of the two cells at 1 mA cm−2 with a capacity of 1 mAh cm−2 are illustrated in Fig. 2(c). The O,N-CC presents a larger charging capacity with a cutoff voltage of 0.5 V, indicating that more Zn can be stripped from the current collector. Meanwhile, the voltage polarization of the O,N-CC is lower than P-CC (inset of Fig. 2c), confirming good reversibility and low Zn ions deposition barrier. Impressively, such nucleation overpotentials of the O,N-CC in asymmetric cells are superior to previously reported current collectors (Fig. 2d) [10–12,15,17,23,24]. The stability of the P-CC@Zn and O,N-CC@Zn electrodes was evaluated by long-term galvanostatic cycling of the symmetrical cells at different current densities. As shown in Fig. 3 (a), the O,N-CC@Zn electrode exhibits a stable voltage profile for 318 h with a low voltage hysteresis at a current density of 1 mA cm−2 with the limited capacity of 1 mAh cm−2. On the contrary, the voltage profiles of P-CC@Zn electrode appear substantial voltage fluctuation after only 45 h, which may be ascribed to the dynamic dendrite-induced soft short circuit [25]. In addition, the evolution of the voltage profiles of the O,N-CC@Zn and P-CC@Zn cells in the enlarged view after 10th, 25th, and 100th cycles are shown in Fig. S4. For the O,N-CC@Zn electrode, throughout the whole cycle, the low voltage hysteresis of 11.2 mV can be kept without evident fluctuation in hysteresis during the charge/discharge process. When cycled at a higher current density of 2 mA cm−2 and higher capacity of 2 mAh cm−2, the O,N-CC@Zn enables the symmetric cell to be stably cycled at a lower voltage hysteresis (less than 14 mV) without short circuits over 240 h, especially at a high depth of discharge (DOD) of 40%, which is superior to the reported cells constructed with various current collectors (Table S1) [10,12,14,17,23,26–28]. The obvious improvement of cycling life can be attributed to the introduced oxygen groups and N heteroatoms regulate the diffusion and deposition of Zn ions, suppressing the growth of dendrite. SEM was used to analyze the morphologies of P-CC@Zn and O,N-CC@Zn before Fig. 3(c and d) and after cycles Fig. 3(e and f). It can be observed that the O,N-CC@Zn surface is covered by the parallel-growing Zn nanosheets, while the P-CC@Zn surface is composed of inhomogeneous and irregular Zn nanosheets (Fig. 3c and d). According to the lower magnified and cross-sectional SEM images, the morphology of P-CC presents a rough and rugged surface with much Zn dendrite and “dead Zn (red circles in the Fig. S5a),” which may contribute to the continuously rising voltage hysteresis and cell failure. Conversely, the Zn flakes are evenly distributed on the O,N-CC, indicating that the O,N-CC can remarkably inhibit the dendrite growth of Zn, which endows O,N-CC@Zn//Zn with a long lifespan. After cycling for 22 cycles at 1 mA cm−2 with a capacity of 1 mAh cm−2, the glass fiber is attached to the surface of CC, which makes it difficult to identify the deposition of the zinc flakes in the cross-sectional images. However, the cross section of the exposed fibers of CC show that more zinc flakes are deposited on O,N-CC (red circles in Fig. S5b and d), which can confirm that the O,N-CC provide more nucleation sites for zinc ions. As shown in Fig. 3(g), the diffraction peaks centered at 36.3°, 39° and 43.2° correspond to the (002), (100) and (101) crystal planes of metallic hexagonal Zn (PDF#04-0831), respectively, indicating the successful depositing of zinc [23,29]. Moreover, the diffraction peaks intensity of (002) facet in the O,N-CC@Zn electrode is higher than that in P-CC@Zn, suggests that the synergistic effect of oxygen-containing functional groups and N heteroatoms is conducive to the growth of Zn along the (002) directions. With respect to Zn anodes with more (002) basal planes being exposed (Zn (002)), Zn deposits tend to initiate along the horizontal direction, guiding the preferential orientation of the zinc crystal growth sequentially parallel to the surface of O,N-CC [30,31]. As expected, there are many sharp flaky Zn on the surface of the cycled P-CC@Zn, while the surface of the O,N-CC@Zn is relatively flat after cycling (Fig. 3e and f), indicating the successful inhibition of Zn dendrite with O,N-CC current collector. The EIS curves of P-CC and O,N-CC were collected within the frequency window from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz (Fig. S6). The charge transfer resistance of the cell with O,N-CC@Zn electrode is smaller than P-CC@Zn electrode, which can be attributed to the doped oxygen functional groups and N heteroatoms that improve the charge transfer and Zn plating/stripping kinetics. To further study the reaction kinetics of Zn plating/stripping on different electrodes, the symmetric cells were cycled under different current densities (Fig. 3h and Fig. S7). The O,N-CC@Zn electrode displays the stable voltage profiles with a lower voltage hysteresis even at high rate states in comparison with the case of cells based on P-CC@Zn electrode, indicating the much improved Zn deposition and dissolution kinetics. 3.3 Mechanism investigation In order to clarify the mechanism of the performance improvement of the O,N-CC current collector, further researches were proposed to analyze the intermediate product O-CC. The asymmetric and symmetric cells were assembled based on the O-CC current collector to investigate the electrochemical behavior. The nucleation overpotential of Zn ions on O-CC are calculated to 26.4, 38.2, and 47.7 mV at current densities of 1, 3, and 5 mA cm−2, respectively (Fig. S8). As shown in Fig. 4 (a), the nucleation overpotential of Zn ions on O-CC is lower than that of the P-CC at various current densities, suggesting that the oxygen-containing functional groups have a positive effect on the transport of Zn ions. The same enhancing phenomenon can also be reflected in the symmetric cells: the lifespan of the O-CC@Zn anode can reach 110 h at a current density of 2 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4b), almost three times that of the P-CC@Zn anode. Compared with the cells constructed by the O-CC current collector, the cells assembled by the O,N-CC show better electrochemical performance, such as lower nucleation overpotential and longer cycle life (Fig. 4c), indicating that the introduction of N heteroatoms into O-CC will further improve its performance. To gain deep insight into the effect of oxygen-containing functional groups on manipulating the diffusion pathways of Zn-ions, the O 1s XPS spectra of P-CC and O-CC were measured (Fig. 4d). In comparison to P-CC, the O-CC sample exhibits a large area of O 1s peak, indicating the improved O content via the acidification process. The ion-accessible surface area can be enhanced due to the existence of the oxygen functional groups. Subsequently, we investigated the variation of the surface area of O-CC and P-CC using the dye-adsorption method [32,33]. The P-CC and O-CC have soaked in the 2 mg L−1 Rhodamine B (RB) aqueous solution for 17 h in dark. ultraviolet and visible (UV–vis) absorption spectra collected for these solutions revealed characteristic absorption peaks of RB (Fig. 4e). The absorption intensity (554 nm) of RB aqueous solution with the O-CC is lower than that of the P-CC, confirming the enhanced ion-accessible surface area in the O-CC sample. Besides, the O 1s core-level spectrum of the O-CC can be deconvoluted into peaks corresponding to >CO (531.4 eV), >COH (532.5 eV), and COOH (533.6 eV) groups (Fig. 4d) [34,35]. In contrast to P-CC, the oxygen groups display higher binding energy based on the density functional theory (DFT) calculation (Fig. 4f) [36], indicating an outstanding ability in capturing Zn-ions thus reducing the transmission barrier of Zn-ion. Subsequently, the N heteroatoms were introduced using a hydrothermal method. As shown in Fig. 4(g), the N 1s peak can be obviously observed compared with O-CC, manifesting the successfully doped of N heteroatoms. The UV–vis absorption spectra of the RB solution with O,N-CC is lower than that with O-CC, which confirms the improvement of the activated sites in the O,N-CC. Moreover, the N 1s peaks can be divided into pyridinic N (Npr 398.2 eV), pyrrolic N (Npr 399.6 eV), and graphitic N (Ngp 402.8 eV) (Fig. 4g) [37,38]. The content of different N species are shown in Table S2, which indicates that the Npr (40.5%) is the most abundant species. The DFT calculation reveals that the binding energy of Npr with Zn atom is −0.45 eV [36], which proves an enhancement of affinity between O,N-CC and Zn-ions. The abundant Npr groups can not only provide the source of active sites for preferential Zn metal deposition but also play a vital role in uniformly depositing of Zn-ions. It is noteworthy that the content of oxygen groups is reduced during the hydrothermal process, but it also keeps a higher content compared with P-CC. To estimate the important role of N heteroatoms doped in CC, We have prepared the N doped CC (N-CC) by treating the O,N-CC at 800 °C with N2 atmosphere for 1 h, which is an efficient method to remove the oxygen functional groups on surface of carbon-based materials [39,40]. Fig. S9(a) shows the clear contrast of the nucleation overpotential for the as-prepared electrodes. It can be seen that the asymmetric cell based on the N-CC@Zn electrode exhibits a nucleation overpotential of 22.3 mV, which is between the P-CC@Zn (36.5 mV) and O,N-CC@Zn (16.7 mV). As shown in Fig. S9(b), the lifetime of the symmetric cell constructed with the N-CC@Zn (190 h) is higher than that of P-CC@Zn (44 h), but lower than that of O,N-CC@Zn (318 h). These results indicate that the co-doped of N heteroatoms and oxygen functional groups in the CC can reduce the Zn nucleation barriers and enhance the lifetime of the cells. The contact angles of O,N-CC and P-CC with water are shown in Fig. 4(h). Compared with P-CC (136.86°), the contact angle between the O,N-CC and electrolyte (126.01°) is decreased, which will be beneficial to the permeability of electrolyte. The enhanced hydrophilicity will reduce the interfacial free energy between the Zn substrate and the electrolyte, contributing to the formation of homogeneous plating and nucleation. In addition, the O,N-CC owns a larger electrochemical active surface area (Fig. 4i), suggesting that the introduction of N heteroatoms and O functional groups have endowed the O,N-CC current collector with more active sites [41–43] (details see the Supporting Information). Reduced local current density, which is deduced by the increased surface area, can promote the uniform deposition of Zn ions. Such an area increment allows a lower nucleation overpotential, consequently mitigates the dendrite formation. Above all the discussion, the improved cycling performance of the O,N-CC@Zn anode is mostly due to the synergistic effect of oxygen-containing groups and N heteroatoms. 3.4 Full devices design Inspired by the successful construction of dendrite-free O,N-CC@Zn anode, the Zn anodes prepared with different current collectors coupled with AC cathodes were assembled to assess its effectiveness and practicability in full devices. The AC powder possesses a large specific surface area of 1870.9 m2 g−1 (Fig. 5 a). As shown in Fig. S11(a), the XRD patterns show the broaden diffraction peak centered at 22° and 43°, corresponding to the diffractions of graphitic carbon with the amorphous character [44]. In addition, The AC particles have irregular shapes and relatively rough surfaces (Fig. S11b). The O,N-CC@Zn//AC can work in a voltage window of 0.2–1.8 V, their CV curves at various scan rates were collected in Fig. 5(b). Clearly, these non-ideal rectangular curves reveal the different energy storage mechanisms of the AC cathode and O,N-CC@Zn anode [45]. As shown in Fig. 5(c), the GCD curves of the P-CC@Zn//AC and O,N-CC@Zn//AC indicate that the full device constructed with the O,N-CC current collector owes enhanced electrochemical performance. Fig. 5(d) shows the calculated result of the specific capacitance based on the GCD results (calculation details see Supporting Information) [46,47]. The specific capacitance of the O,N-CC@Zn//AC device is calculated to 185.75 F g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1. Similarly, as shown in Fig. S12, the Ragone plot based on the O,N-CC@Zn anode exhibits higher energy densities at various power densities compared with P-CC@Zn, further indicating that the N and O doping can possess rapid charging and high energy storage characteristics of the devices. The Nyquist plot of the zinc-ion supercapacitors based on O,N-CC@Zn anodes exhibited a smaller semicircle (Fig. S13), proving that the synergistic effect between the large surface area and the good wettability of the O,N-CC@Zn electrode could enhance the ability of electron and ion transport [48]. Furthermore, long-term cycling stability is another critical parameter of the full devices. The cycling stability of the full devices were evaluated at a current density of 5 A g−1 for 10000 cycles. The capacitance retentions of the O,N-CC@Zn anode after 10000 cycles are 92.1% (Fig. 5e), while the P-CC@Zn suffers a great decrease after 9000 cycles and remains only 34.9% of initial capacity after 10000 cycles. These encouraging results confirm the excellent electrochemical performance of the O,N-CC@Zn anode in practical application. 4 Conclusions In summary, we prepare a novel O,N-CC current collector via a simple acidification and hydrothermal doping process, which offers an efficient solution to inhibit the growth of dendrites. The abundant oxygen-containing functional groups and N heteroatoms can not only provide uniform nucleation sites for Zn deposition but also facilitate the homogeneous transport of Zn ions. Furthermore, by integrating evidence from diverse characterization techniques, we found that the synergistic effect of the oxygen functional groups and N heteroatoms can guide the directed Zn deposition at the (002) crystal plane. All these integrated merits effectively block intricate side reactions of electrolyte, prevent the generation of Zn dendrites and guarantee uniform Zn plating/stripping with high reversibility. As a result, the symmetric cell with O,N-CC current collector demonstrates prolonged cycling life up to 318 h at a current density of 1 mA cm−2 (20% DOD). Even at a high current density of 10 mA cm−2 with a fixed capacity of 10 mAh cm−2, the O,N-CC can still deliver a high average CE of 99.49%. More importantly, the O,N-CC@Zn anode enables the full cells to achieve excellent capacity retention of 92.1% after 10,000 cycles at a high current density of 5 A g−1. The O,N-CC also suffers some drawbacks such as the binding energy between the N heteroatoms and Zn ions are not strengthen enough, which limits the further application. Based on the above situation, the metallic single atoms or nanoclusters with higher binding energy to Zn can be introduced into the CC, acting as heterometallic seeds for zinc deposition, which can reduce the nucleation overpotential of Zn and guide the uniform deposition of Zn ions on current collectors. In summery, this work provides a simple and controllable way to prepare three dimensional O,N-CC current collector, which can open up a new way for the development of Zn metal anodes toward the next generation large-scale energy storage application.

        "dc:description": "The society’s urgent demand for environmentally friendly, safe and low-cost energy storage devices has promoted the research of aqueous zinc-ion batteries. However, the uneven deposition of Zn ions on anodes will lead to the growth of the dendrite and reduce the Coulombic efficiency as well as the lifespan of the devices. Herein, we construct an O,N-dual functionalized carbon cloth current collector via a simple hydrothermal strategy, in which the oxygen-containing functional groups and the N heteroatoms can regulate the transmission and deposition of Zn ions, respectively. The proposed synergistic strategy ensures the uniform distribution of Zn ions on the surface of the Zn anode and inhibits the formation of dendrites. The symmetric cell based on the O,N-dual doped carbon cloth presents superior cycling stability (318 h) with a low voltage hysteresis (11.2 mV) at an areal capacity of 1 mAh cm−2 (20% depth of diacharge). Meanwhile, the appreciably low overpotential (16 mV) and high Columbic efficiency (98.2%) also demonstrate that the O,N-dual functionalized carbon cloth can be worked as a promising host for Zn ions deposition.",
