College of Chemical Engineering Nanjing Tech University Nanjing 210009 PR China Graphical abstract Ultrafine cobalt oxide nanoparticles embedded in porous SiO2 matrix were facilely prepared by a spontaneous deposition method, which were applied to catalytic methane combustion. Owing to rich surface active oxygen and more active sites, the CoOx@SiO2-400 catalyst shows the highest catalytic activity. These structural catalyst also show high thermal stability and efficient moisture resistance. Ultrafine cobalt oxide nanoparticles embedded in porous SiO2 matrix were facilely prepared by a spontaneous deposition method, which were applied to catalytic methane combustion. Among the serial of CoOx@SiO2-T catalysts, the CoOx@SiO2-400 catalyst with the smallest particle size (˜1.3 nm) has the highest activity, showing an obvious size-dependent activity. Based on the XPS, O2-TPD and H2-TPR analyses, it indicated that the CoOx@SiO2-400 catalyst possessed a higher ratio of surface absorbed oxygen and lattice oxygen (Oads/Olatt) and more active sites, which enabled the enhancement of its catalytic activity. Compared with simply supported CoOx/SiO2-400 catalyst, the embedded CoOx@SiO2-400 catalyst show superior catalytic performance under dry/moisture conditions owing to silica encapsulation. As for possible CH4 combustion mechanism, the intermediate of Co-formate is determined by in-situ DRIFTS. Keywords Embedded Cobalt oxide Porous SiO2 Catalytic combustion Methane 1 Introduction Natural gas, mainly composed of methane, is widely applied in power generation, such as internal combustion engines and natural-gas vehicles. However, unburned methane is harmful to the environment. As reported, the greenhouse effect of CH4 is 20 times higher than that of CO2 [1]. Catalytic combustion technology was considered as a promising technology to remove unburned CH4 [2]. Noble metal based catalysts, such as Pd and Pt, are effective in the catalytic combustion CH4 [3–13]. The high cost and limited availability restrict their application. Many metal oxides catalysts, such as the reported Mn-, Co- and Ni-based composite oxides [14–17] and perovskite-type catalysts [18–21], were developed for methane combustion. Cobalt oxides have demonstrated superior performance for catalytic oxidation [22–28]. Among these transition metal oxides, cobalt oxide catalysts have presented great potential and are usually used in catalytic oxidation reactions, due to variable valence states (Co2+/Co3+) and abundance oxygen active species [22,25,28]. Co3O4/γ-Al2O3 supported catalysts were prepared by a combination of impregnation and combustion synthesis, exhibiting excellent catalytic performance for methane combustion. It indicated that the Co3O4 dispersion could facilitate the migration of surface Co3+ and the redox cycle between Co2+ and Co3+ at a lower temperature [26]. As well-known, the higher dispersion of active sites is closely related with particle sizes. Sintering of nanoparticles is unavoidable during reaction process, even under mid/high temperature [29,30]. Encapsulating metal (or oxides) nanoparticles into porous inorganic matrix has been verified as a good strategy for stabilizing catalyst [31]. Porous SiO2 shell encapsulated metal (Pt or Ni) catalyst were applied in CO oxidation and CH4-related oxidation or reforming, showing high thermal stability [32–34]. Herein, we prepared embedded CoOx@SiO2 catalysts with highly dispersed cobalt oxides nanoparticles and porous structure. And they were used for catalytic combustion of CH4. Various characterizations, such as XRD, BET, TEM, XPS, H2-TPR and O2-TPD, were employed to investigate the morphology, structure, surface properties and redox properties of prepared catalysts. The catalytic performance was correlated with their physical and chemical properties. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Catalyst preparation The CoOx nanoparticles embedded in a porous SiO2 matrix (CoOx@SiO2) were prepared by a spontaneous deposition method. Typically, TEOS (0.05 mol), Co(NO3)2•6H2O (0.05 mol) were subsequently dissolved in the mixture solvent composed of ethanol (250 mL) and deionized water (82.5 mL). After stirring at room temperature for 0.5 h, acetic acid (1.2 mol) was dropped into the solution. 0.5 h later, formamide (0.1 mol) and C3H6O (100 mL) were also added with vigorous agitation. The gelation continued under the conditions of refluxing at 60 °C for 6 h. The obtained sample was aged overnight at R.T. The architecture of CoOx@SiO2-T was obtained after drying at 60 °C under vacuum for 48 h and calcination at T °C (T = 400, 600, 800) in air for 3 h. 2.2 Catalyst characterization X-ray diffraction patterns were adopted on a SmartLab X-ray Diffractometer (Rigaku Corporation, Japan), with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) at 40 kV and 100 mA in a scanning range of 10-80° (2θ) with a step of 0.02°. N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of the samples were performed at -196 ℃ using a BEL sorp II apparatus. The samples were pretreated under high vacuum condition at 200 °C for 4 h before measurement. The specific surface area was calculated from the isotherms using the BET method. The average pore diameters and cumulative volume of pores were obtained by the BJH method from the desorption regimes of the isotherms. TEM images were taken over a JEOL JEM-2000EX instrument operated at 200 kV. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterization was carried out on a QUANTA-200 apparatus to get the surface profile of the samples. XPS data were obtained with an ESCALab220i-XL electron spectrometer from VG Scientific using 300 W Al-K radiations. The base pressure was approximately 3 × 10−9 mbar. The binding energies were referenced to the C1 s line at 284.8 eV from adventitious carbon. H2-TPR was performed in Auto Chem 2920(Micomeritics, America)with a mixture of 10 vol% H2/Ar as the reducing gas with a flow rate of 30 mL min−1. 50 mg of catalyst was pre-treated in Ar at 200 °C for 1 h to remove the adsorbed species. After cooling down to room temperature, the reduction was performed from 50 to 900 °C. The H2 consumption during reduction was measured using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The TCD signal was calibrated by the quantitative reduction of Ag2O to the metallic silver. Oxygen temperature programmed desorption (O2-TPD) experiment was performed in a U-shaped quartz reactor and the signal of desorption oxygen was recorded by Auto Chem 2920 (Micomeritics, America). Firstly, 50 mg of catalyst was pretreated in a 4 vol% O2/He flow at 400 °C for 30 min. After cooled down to 50 °C under the same oxidative atmosphere, the catalyst was purged by a stream of purified He (30 mL·min−1) until stabilization of the instrument baseline. Then, the reactor was heated up to 800 °C at an increasing rate of 10 °C/min. The in-situ DRIFT was carried out on Nicolet Fourier Infrared Spectrum with diffuse reflection situ pool and high delicacy MCT detector. The DRIFT spectra during methane combustion experiment were recorded with a Nicolet Nexus spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled MCT detector, collecting 100 scans at a spectral resolution of 4 cm−1. Prior to each experiment, samples were oxidized in a flow of 10 vol.% O2 at 200 °C for 60 min. The reactions in the cell were performed under a flow of 20 mL/min gas mixture containing methane and oxygen with N2 as balance gas. 2.3 Catalyst evaluation Catalytic activity tests were performed in quartz fixed bed reactor, and 1 g catalyst (20–40 meshes) mixing with 10 g Quartz sand was filled up. SV (Space Velocity) was 15,000 mL/(g·h) with a total flow of 250 mL·min−1, O2 take up 20%. The reaction feed consisted of 2% CH4 with N2 as the balance gas, and the gases in the outlet were analyzed on-line by GC with FID and TCD detectors. To further investigate the mixture effect in feed stream, 5 vol% water were also added into the system. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Structural characterization XRD patterns for various CoOx@SiO2 nanocomposites are presented in Fig.1 . For CoOx@SiO2-800 sample, the diffraction peaks located at 31.2°, 36.7°, 44.7°, 59.3° and 65.1° were recorded, assigning as the (220), (311), (400), (511) and (440) crystalline planes of Co3O4 (JCPDS No. 42–1467), respectively. It can be seen that partial reflection peaks of Co3O4 disappears when the calcination temperature decreases from 800 to 600 °C. As for CoOx@SiO2-400 sample, only two weak detectable broad diffraction peaks are observed at around 36.7° and 59.3°, which are attributed to (311) and (511) crystalline planes of Co3O4. It can be concluded that the mean crystallite sizes of cobalt oxides are below the detection limit of XRD (˜3 nm). We also calculated the mean crystallite size by the Scherrer equation using the FWHMs of the (311) line of Co3O4. The mean crystallite sizes of CoOx@SiO2-800 and CoOx@SiO2-600 samples are 12.1 and 8.1 nm, respectively (Table 1 ). This means that higher calcination temperature would result in a well crystal structure and large grains. The morphology and structure were further characterized by TEM analysis (Fig. 2 ). It demonstrated that the cobalt oxide nanoparticles are homogeneously and highly dispersed in SiO2 matrix, showing a relatively narrow particles size distribution. With an increase of calcination temperature, the particle size of CoOx nanoparticles increases gradually. The statistics sizes of CoOx@SiO2-400, CoOx@SiO2-600 and CoOx@SiO2-800 samples are 1.3, 5.6 and 8.3 nm respectively. The results are in accordance with the XRD analyzes. The CoOx@SiO2-400 sample has the smallest particle size, generating more active sites, conversely contributing to higher activity [35,36]. In addition, the Co, O and Si elements are highly dispersed in CoOx@SiO2-400 sample, which is determined by the elemental mappings (Fig. 2d). Fig. 3 shows the N2 sorption isotherms and pore-size distributions of the serial CoOx@SiO2-T catalysts. It can be observed that representative type-Ⅳ curves with H2 hysteresis loops. Owing to capillary condensation, nitrogen filling occurs approximately at p/p0 = 0.4-0.8, reflecting mesopores characteristic. And the pore size distributions are centered at 3.5, 4.6 and 6.0 nm for CoOx@SiO2-400, CoOx@SiO2-600 and CoOx@SiO2-800 sample respectively. It demonstrated that the use of formamide in synthetic process is helpful for achieving uniform pore structure. The calculated BET surface areas, pore volumes and pore sizes are shown in Table 1. The CoOx@SiO2-400 sample has the largest surface area of 389 m2 g−1 and pore volume of 0.43 m3 g−1. With a rise of calcination temperature from 600 to 800 °C, the surface areas decrease from 389 to 225 m2 g−1, the corresponding pore volumes also shrink. On the basis of the spontaneous deposition method, most of cobalt oxides are completely encapsulated in silica matrix. Thus, the change of physical properties of the serial CoOx@SiO2-T samples are largely dependent on the change of silica microstructure. H2-TPR was carried out to evaluate the reduction behavior of the cobalt oxides species in samples. Fig. 4 shows the H2-TPR profiles for various CoOx@SiO2 samples. One obvious continuous peak is below 420 °C over CoOx@SiO2-600 and CoOx@SiO2-800 samples, which are ascribed to the stepwise processes of Co3+ to Co2+ and Co2+ to metallic Co0, in accordance with the previous studies [35,37,38]. Note that only an continuous increase curve below 420 °C is observed for CoOx@SiO2-400 sample. The other H2 consumption peak of CoOx@SiO2-400 sample is centered at around 740 °C, which is larger than that of other samples. It also found that the reduction peaks gradually shift to lower temperature. And the reduction peaks is located at 660 °C for CoOx@SiO2-800 sample. It has been reported that the other broad reduction peak located at higher temperature (around 700 °C) was attributed to a strong interaction between cobalt oxides and support (small cobalt oxide crystallites, cobalt silicates) [39,40]. However, the cobalt silicates is hard to form at the calcination temperature of 400 °C for CoOx@SiO2-400 sample. Previous study also indicated that in silica-supported catalysts smaller cobalt oxide particles were more difficult to reduce than the larger ones [41]. And the reduction peaks situated between 553 K and 723 K are corresponded to easy reducible cobalt species. Hence, in our study the shift of TPR peaks to higher temperatures can be attributed to a higher fraction of more hardly reducible smaller cobalt oxide particles in the CoOx@SiO2-400 sample. Additionally, we can also notice that the bulk Co3+/Co2+ ratios gradually increase with a rise of calcination temperature. The CoOx@SiO2-800 sample has a larger reduction peak of Co3+ species than that of other samples. And the CoOx@SiO2-400 sample has the lowest Co3+ species. Fig. 5 shows the O2-TPD profiles of various CoOx@SiO2 catalysts, exhibiting the adsorption/activation capability of all the catalysts towards oxygen species. Generally, surface adsorption oxygen (O2 − and O−) are easily desorbed at below 300 °C, belonging to the surface active oxygen. Whereas the lattice oxygen (O2-) is extremely difficult to desorb, taking place at above 500 °C [42–45]. Seen from Fig. 5, two obvious desorption peaks are observed at below and above 200 °C. Ye et al. [48] pointed out that the oxygen desorption peak of Co3O4 nanocatalyst at 80–120 °C is assigned as molecular oxygen species adsorbed on oxygen vacancy. And other desorption peak located at 120–450 °C is attributed to surface adsorbed oxygen ion. In our study the first oxygen desorption peak at below 200 °C can be assigned as the molecular adsorption oxygen (O2 −) and partial of surface chemical adsorption oxygen. According to the calculated peak areas, the CoOx@SiO2-400 sample has the largest O2 desorption amounts (corresponding to α peak) (Table 1). With a rise of calcination temperature, the intensity of oxygen desorption peak (α) gradually decrease. Whereas the intensity of oxygen desorption peak (β) increase. As it has been reported that more surface-active oxygen species, desorbed at lower temperature, was responsible to higher catalytic activity [37,46]. It can be concluded that O2 desorption amounts (at α peak) are directly related to the catalytic activity, and have a great influence on activity. XPS spectra of Co 2p and O 1 s are shown in Fig. 6 . Fig. 6A shows the O 1 s XPS spectra of the serial CoOx@SiO2-T samples. Two main components peaks at 529.4 and 531.5 eV were well fitted, which are indexed as surface lattice oxygen (Olatt) species and surface adsorbed oxygen (Oads) species respectively [47,48]. The ratios (Oads/Olatt) are 1.04, 0.52, and 0.43 for the CoOx@SiO2-400, CoOx@SiO2-600 and CoOx@SiO2-800 catalysts respectively (Table 2 ). In Fig. 6B, Co (2p3/2) has two components at binding energy about 779.6 eV and 780.6 eV corresponding to Co3+ and Co2+ ions, and Co (2p1/2) was also deconvoluted into two components peaks of Co3+ (ca. 795.6 eV) and Co2+ (ca. 796.4 eV) [24,47]. The surface Co3+/Co2+ ratios are 1.19, 1.39 and 2.56 for the CoOx@SiO2-400, CoOx@SiO2-600 and CoOx@SiO2-800 catalysts respectively (Table 2). The surface Co3+/Co2+ ratios are consistent with the bulk ones, which is evidenced by TPR characterization. Notable that the surface Co3+ and adsorption oxygen species exhibit the opposite order in these prepared catalysts. In the case of CoOx@SiO2-400 sample, it has the most surface active oxygen (Oads) species and the least surface Co3+ species. Previous studies indicated that more surface Co3+ and Oads species contributes the higher catalytic performance [24,48,49]. However, in our study, it might be assumed that surface active oxygen species have a significant effect on superior activity. 3.2 Catalytic performance Fig. 7 a presents the methane conversion over different catalysts as a function of reaction temperature under the condition of GHSV = 15,000 h−1. With a rise on reaction temperature, the CH4 conversion increases due to thermodynamic behavior. The catalytic activity of CH4 oxidation decrease in the order: CoOx@SiO2-400 > CoOx@SiO2-600 > CoOx@SiO2-800. The CoOx@SiO2-400 catalyst shows the highest activity with a 100% CH4 conversion at 330 °C. Based on above O2-TPD and XPS analyses, we found that the CoOx@SiO2-400 catalyst has the most surface adsorption oxygen, which is responsible to activation of O2 molecules [25,49]. Some researchers also demonstrated that smaller Co3O4 nanoparticles generates more active sites and active oxygen, also contributing to enhanced oxidation properties [35,36,50]. The apparent activation energies (Ea) value of different catalysts were calculated by Arrhenius equation {Ln(r) = LnA- Ea/RT} (Fig. 7b). There are only slight difference for Ea values among the serial CoOx@SiO2-T catalysts. The corresponding Ea values are 73.4, 72.7 and 69.8 kJ mol−1 respectively, indicating the similar reaction pathway. And the corresponding preexponential factors (LnA) are 13.5, 12.5 and 11.0 for CoOx@SiO2-400, CoOx@SiO2-600 and CoOx@SiO2-800 catalysts. This means that the CoOx@SiO2-400 catalyst have more active sites than that of other catalysts. Additionally, the stability of the serial CoOx@SiO2-T catalysts were also performed under dry/wet gas conditions (Fig. 7c). There is no significant decrease for the CH4 conversions over various CoOx@SiO2-T catalysts in the dry feed gas within 30 h. After 5 vol% H2O was introduced in reaction process, the CH4 conversions decreased obviously but remained unchanged over nearly 40 h experiments. This result indicates that water vapor inhibits the catalytic efficiency due to competitive adsorption of water and reaction molecules on the active sites [49]. After the water vapor was removed, the CH4 conversion nearly recovered, suggesting the structure of CoOx@SiO2-T catalysts keep well and were not poisoned under the moisture condition. In addition, the compared supported CoOx/SiO2-400 catalyst were also prepared. The contrast activities are presented in Fig. 8 . Owing to the difference of preparation methods, the activity of CoOx/SiO2-400 catalyst is lower than that of CoOx@SiO2-400 catalyst, showing a ˜60% CH4 conversion at 400 °C with a SV of 15,000 h−1. The stability test of CoOx/SiO2-400 catalyst were also carried out at 370 °C under the dry/moisture conditions. Within 5 h at the beginning time, the activity drops dramatically. Then, the activity data remains at around 23%. After 5 vol% water was introduced into reaction system, the activity decreases first and then remains stable. After removing water, the activity nearly recovered. Compared with the performance of CoOx/SiO2-400 catalyst, the embedded structural CoOx@SiO2-400 catalyst shows superior catalytic performance. 3.3 DRIFTS studies The in situ DRIFTS spectra of co-adsorption of methane and oxygen on CoOx@SiO2-400 catalyst from 50 to 300 °C are presented in Fig. 9 , and they were taken in the flow of 2% methane and 20% oxygen (N2 as balance). Bands at 3016 cm−1, 1630 cm−1, 1574 cm−1, 1345 cm−1 and 1304 cm−1 were found. Bands rose at 3016 cm−1 and 1304 cm−1 are due to CH bonds in physically adsorbed methane [51]. With the rise of temperature, the bands at 1630 cm−1 gradually disappears, and the bands at 1574 cm−1 gradually becomes obvious. As we know, the adsorption bands in the region of 1300-1400 cm−1 and 1500-1700 cm−1 were respectively attributed to the symmetric OCO stretching mode and the asymmetric OCO stretching mode of dissociated adsorbed formate [52,53]. Besides, the bands at 1345 cm−1 also confirm the formation of Co-formate [51], most likely in monodentate form, and bands at 1630 cm−1 could be attributed to hydroxyl group. These results agree well with the previous finding [54] that carbonate and formate species are the main intermediates during lean CH4 catalytic oxidation reaction. 4 Conclusions In summary, a series of porous SiO2 encapsulated cobalt oxides catalysts were prepared via a spontaneous method and subsequent calcination. When the precursors were calcined at 400, 600 and 800 °C, the corresponding particle sizes of cobalt oxides are respectively. Among these catalysts, the CoOx@SiO2-400 catalyst with the smallest particle size (1.3 nm) has the highest activity, showing a 100% CH4 conversion at reaction condition (330 °C and 15,000 h−1). On the basis of various characterizations, the higher activity should be attributed to abundant surface active oxygen, more active sites and more active sites. All these catalysts were also evaluated in dry/moisture reaction conditions, showing high thermal stability and efficient moisture resistance. Compared supported CoOx/SiO2-400 catalyst, the embedded CoOx@SiO2-400 catalyst show superior catalytic performance. At last, the possible CH4 combustion mechanism was provided by in situ DRIFTS, and the intermediate of Co-formate was determined.
