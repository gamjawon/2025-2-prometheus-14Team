Graphical abstract Cu/ZnO_X catalysts were prepared by a co-precipitation method with various aging times of the precipitate (X=10min–10h). All prepared catalysts were evaluated in alcohol-assisted methanol synthesis through a low temperature liquid phase reaction using a batch type reactor under a reaction pressure of 50bar at a temperature of 150°C. Unlike the conventional low temperature methanol synthesis, ethanol was adopted as both the solvent and the reaction intermediate in this study. Variation of the aging time of the precipitate led to numerous changes in the surface properties of catalysts, resulting in the different catalytic activity in this reaction. This means that aging time of the precipitate should be precisely controlled for obtaining an efficient Cu/ZnO catalyst by a co-precipitation method. The results of catalytic activities and catalyst characterizations clearly demonstrated that the copper particle size, the morphology, and the strong acidity of the Cu/ZnO catalysts played key roles in this reaction. Small copper particle size, plate-like morphology, and high strong acidity of the catalysts were favorable for efficiently producing methanol in this reaction. Among the Cu/ZnO_X catalysts, the Cu/ZnO_5h catalyst showed the best catalytic activity. According to the proposed reaction pathway, not only the intrinsic activity of metallic copper but also the acid properties of catalysts were important factors to determine the activity of Cu/ZnO catalysts in this reaction. Keywords Methanol synthesis Alcohol-assisted Low temperature Cu/ZnO Co-precipitation Aging time 1 Introduction Methanol is widely used as a chemical feedstock for important chemicals such as formaldehyde, dimethyl terephthalate, methyl methacrylate, and acetic acid, as well as energy sources such as olefins, gasoline, and DME [1–6]. Methanol is also used as a clean liquid fuel for fuel cell applications [7–10]. Compared to most other sources, methanol is very clean and the combustion of methanol in engines does not produce harmful by-products such as NOx or SOx, which are produced from conventional fuel [11–14]. For such reasons, cost-effective methanol production has become one of the hottest issues in the research field of catalytic process. Various techniques for methanol synthesis processes have been employed by numerous researchers and impressive improvements have been made throughout the 20th century. Methanol synthesis from syngas over solid catalysts was first reported by Patart in 1921 [15,16]. Then, BASF launched the first industrial methanol plant using a ZnO-Cr2O3 catalyst under high reaction pressure and temperature conditions (ca. 240–340bar and 623–673K). The ZnO-Cr2O3 catalyst also produced methane and other light hydrocarbons with relatively low selectivity [17]. The source of syngas, which is a feedstock for methanol synthesis, was changed from coal to naphtha or natural gas in the 1960s, which led to less impurities in the syngas, especially sulfur. Thereafter, Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts were employed as the main catalyst for methanol synthesis. In commercial plants, conventional methanol synthesis from syngas was developed by ICI Co. LTd., with lower reaction pressure and temperature conditions, namely 60–80bar and 523–553K using a Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst. The ICI methanol synthesis process is still adopted commercially [4–7]. The lower temperature and pressure of the reaction led to an improvement of inhibited selectivity of light hydrocarbons and by-products. In addition, the low reaction temperature resulted in a decrease of cooling duty by about 5–10% by preventing released heat from side reactions, namely the CH4 forming reaction. After the commercial methanol synthesis process was developed, current methanol synthesis plants now produce over 5000 tons every day. The reaction pathway for conventional methanol synthesis from syngas over a copper-based catalyst is shown below. CO+2H2 ↔CH3OH (g), ΔH298 =−90.97kJ/mol Methanol synthesis from syngas is an exothermic reaction, and consequently the conversion of syngas to methanol is influenced by thermodynamic factors [18–21]. Thermodynamic equilibrium limits the low one-pass conversion to 15–25% and accordingly, the unreacted syngas must be recycled, leading to high production costs. Furthermore, the reaction is strongly exothermic requiring cooling. Thermodynamically, the methanol synthesis reaction is favored to proceed at a high reaction pressure and low temperature, which elevates the importance of heat control. Recently, low temperature methanol synthesis (LTMS) has received considerable attention. A homogeneous process in a flow type semi-batch reactor over a strong base catalyst of NaH and Ni(CH3COO)2 was developed by the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) [22–25]. The reaction is conducted at a pressure of 10–50bar and a temperature of 373–403K, and its remarkable high CO conversion and selectivity for methanol are very attractive. However, the strong base catalyst is easy to deactivate by CO2 and H2O present in the feed gas. This results in a high cost for the purification of syngas and catalyst recycling, preventing commercialization of this methanol synthesis process. Another methanol synthesis mechanism from CO/H2 at a lower temperature was proposed by Christiansen’s group. The proposed mechanism consists of two steps involving the carbonylation of methanol and the hydrogenolysis of methyl formate. However, CO2 and H2O also act as catalyst poisons, similar to the BNL process. In other words, commercialization of this process is hindered by purification and the catalyst recycling process. Tsubaki et al. proposed a low-temperature methanol synthesis process in a batch type reactor under significantly mild conditions, including a reaction temperature of 423–443K and a pressure of 30–50bar. Moreover, CO2 and H2O in the feed gas act not as catalyst poisons but as reactants, indicating that additional separation process of CO2 and H2O in the syngas is not needed. This could result in a decrease of methanol production cost, in turn, a high feasibility of commercialization [26–28]. This LTMS process alcohol is adopted as a catalytic solvent and reaction intermediate such that the reaction does not proceed in the absence of alcohol and its reaction mechanism does not occur. A conventional Cu-based oxide catalyst has been considered as a catalyst for this reaction. Copper-based catalysts, especially Cu/ZnO, have been mainly employed in the methanol synthesis process because of its high catalytic activity, poison resistance, and high durability [29,30]. However, many researchers are still trying to develop better catalysts for methanol synthesis with a relatively low reaction temperature and pressure. In order to improve the activity and stability of the catalyst, modification of a Cu-based catalyst for methanol synthesis has been extensively attempted by many researchers. Recently, we investigated the alcohol-assisted low temperature methanol synthesis from syngas over a Cu/ZnO catalyst prepared by co-precipitation. In this work, a series of Cu/ZnO_X catalysts were prepared by a co-precipitation method with various aging times (X) of the precipitate. The effect of the aging time of the precipitate in the co-precipitation step on the activity of Cu/ZnO catalysts for this reaction was investigated. Various characterization methods, including XRD, ICP-AES, N2 adsorption-desorption, and NH3-TPD analyses, were carried out to determine the effect of the aging time of the precipitate. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation Cu/ZnO_X catalysts were prepared by a conventional co-precipitation method with various aging times (X) in the co-precipitation step. Copper nitrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, Wako) and zinc nitrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, Wako) were employed as the metal precursors and sodium carbonate ((Na2CO3, Kanto chemical Co.) was used as a precipitant. 1M copper nitrate and zinc nitrate were dissolved in distilled water and 1.5M sodium carbonate was also dissolved in distilled water. The solutions were added dropwise into 600ml of distilled water at 70°C under vigorous stirring. The pH of the precipitated solution was maintained at 8 using a sodium carbonate solution. During the co-precipitation step, the pH and temperature were precisely controlled to enable homogeneous distribution of the metal precursor in the amorphous initial precipitate. The resulting solution was then stirred for various times ranging from 10min to 10h at 70°C. When the precipitates were aged for various times, the amorphous precipitates transformed into crystalline Cu-Zn hydroxycarbonate precursors. The precipitates obtained after various aging times were filtered and washed with distilled water to remove the residue ions. The obtained solid product was dried overnight at 120°C. The dried sample was then calcined at 350°C for 1h in an air stream and then reduced in a stream of 30% hydrogen based on nitrogen at 350°C for 2h. The passivation step was conducted to prevent the rapid oxidation of metallic copper into copper oxide due to oxygen present in the air. The passivation step was carried out in a stream of 1% oxygen diluted with argon at room temperature for 1h. The prepared catalysts were denoted as Cu/ZnO_X, where X represents the aging time of the precipitates in the co-precipitation step. 2.2 Catalyst characterization The phase analysis of Cu/ZnO was performed using X’pert-pro powder XRD (PANalytical) with Cu-Kα radiation (λ=1.54056Å). XRD patterns of the samples were collected in the 2θ range of 10°–80° with a scan step of 0.03° at 40kV and 40mA. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of the catalyst was determined by a N2 adsorption-desorption method using a BELSORP-mini II (BEL Japan). The Cu/Zn molar ratio of the catalysts was evaluated by ICP-AES (Prodigy, Teledyne Leeman Labs) analysis. SEM measurements were performed to investigate the surface morphology of the catalysts with an S-4800 (Hitachi) using an electron beam with an energy of 5kV. Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) was carried out using a conventional TPD instrument (BELCAT B, BEL Japan). The details of the experimental method are as follows. Each catalyst (ca. 0.1g) was charged into the quartz reactor of the TPD apparatus. Prior to conducting the TPD experiments, the adsorbed organic impurities of the catalyst surface were removed at 100°C for 1h under a stream of helium. NH3 was introduced to the catalyst at 50°C for 1h to adsorb at the acid sites of the catalyst. The physisorbed NH3 was then removed by helium gas at 50°C for 1h. The desorption was carried out in the temperature range of 50–600°C with a heating rate of 10°C/min. With increasing temperature, the desorbed NH3 was detected by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). 2.3 Reaction procedure Alcohol-assisted methanol synthesis through a low temperature liquid phase reaction was performed using a batch reactor with an inner volume of 180ml. 50ml of ethanol were first loaded into the reactor as the solvent and reaction medium, and then 3g of the Cu/ZnO_X catalyst were introduced into the reactor. The air in the reactor was purged by CO2 gas for 1min and the reactant gas mixture of H2, CO, and CO2 was injected into the reactor at a constant ratio of 65:30:5, respectively. The reactor was pressurized with the reactant gas to an initial pressure of 36bar, which reached 50bar when the reactor temperature increased to 150°C. The reactor was then heated to the reaction temperature of 150°C. When the reactor temperature reached the desired temperature of 150°C, the reactor was stirred at a stirring speed of 700rpm. The catalytic reaction was accomplished at 50bar and 150°C for 20h under a stirring speed of 700rpm. After completing the reaction, the reactor was cooled down to room temperature using cooling water and then, the liquid products were collected for quantitative and qualitative analyses. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of the liquid products were performed using a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID), (YL-6500, Yonglin). An HP-PLOT Q column (30m×0.53mm I.D., 40μm film thickness) was employed to separate the reaction products, and 2-propanol was used as an internal standard to quantify the products. The yield and selectivity for the products were calculated using quantitative data and the following equations. Selectivity for A ( % ) = moles of A formed total moles of products formed × 100 Yield for A ( % ) = moles of A formed moles of CO and C O 2 ⁡ supplied × 100 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalyst characterization There are three representative mineral structures in the naturally occurring Cu-Zn hydroxycarbonate precursors depending on the metal composition, including aurichalcite ((Cu1−xZnx)5(OH)6(CO3)2, with x>0.5), zincian malachite ((Cu1−yZny)2(OH)2CO3, with y<0.3), and rosasite ((Cu1−zZnz)2(OH)2CO3, with 0.3<z<0.5) [31,32]. The existence of these stable mineral structures allow Cu/ZnO catalysts to maintain their high copper dispersion in spite of significant high copper content in the catalysts. In other words, the metal components in the Cu/ZnO catalysts can be homogeneously distributed in the final catalysts by the formation of Cu-Zn hydroxycarbonate precursors during the co-precipitation step. There are so many parameters that can affect the successful formation of Cu/ZnO catalysts by a co-precipitation method, including precipitation method, pH value, temperature, molar ratio, aging time, etc. According to the literature [32], the synthetic parameters during the very early stage of preparation process have a strong influence on the physiochemical properties of precursor materials, in turn, the catalytic activity of the final catalysts. This effect is generally called chemical memory in the Cu/ZnO catalyst system. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding about co-precipitated precursors for Cu/ZnO catalysts is very important for further optimization of Cu/ZnO catalysts for methanol production. The effect of various precipitates phases on the catalytic activity of Cu/ZnO has been evaluated in many studies [33–35]. According to the reported results, a high catalytic activity and fine dispersion of Cu could be obtained from the co-precipitated precursors of aurichalcite or zincian malachite in the preparation step of Cu/ZnO catalysts. Successful formation of the precipitates phase was confirmed by XRD measurements. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the co-precipitated precursors for the Cu/ZnO_X catalysts, where all of the catalysts show an aurichalcite phase. As can be observed in the XRD patterns, as the aging time of the precipitates increases, the XRD peak of Cu (111) (2θ=43.2°) became broader (Fig. 2 ). In order to verify the effect of the aging time of the precipitate, the copper crystallite size was calculated using the Scherrer equation (D=Kλ/βcosθ, where K is the Scherer constant, λ is the X-ray wavelength, and D denotes the mean crystallite size). The results are summarized in Table 1 . As expected, the Cu/ZnO_10h catalyst showed the smallest copper crystallite size (ca. 6.8nm) and the copper crystallite size decreased as the aging time increased. This result indicates that the crystallite size of the Cu/ZnO_X catalysts was strongly affected by the aging time of the precipitate. It can be deduced from this result that sufficient aging of the precursor resulted in well-dispersed copper particles and a small crystallite size of copper. Many researchers agree that the particle size of copper is a very important factor for catalytic methanol synthesis from syngas as metallic copper is the main active site for this reaction. Therefore, from Table 1, it can be speculated that the aging time (X) of the precipitate in the co-precipitation step is an important factor in determining the copper crystallite size and accordingly, affects the catalytic activity of the Cu/ZnO_X catalyst in this reaction. The molar ratios of the Cu/ZnO_X catalysts prepared with various aging times of the precipitate were determined by ICP-AES analysis, and the corresponding results are listed in Table 1. The molar ratios of Cu/Zn were almost 1 in all of the Cu/ZnO_X catalysts, indicating that all of the catalysts were successfully prepared as designed. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of the Cu/ZnO_X catalyst was also investigated by employing the N2 adsorption-desorption method. The specific surface areas of the Cu/ZnO_X catalysts were found to be in the range of 22.7–33.2m2/g (Table 1) and no correlation between the aging time of the precipitate and the specific surface area was observed in this study. The morphology of the reduced Cu/ZnO_X catalysts was evaluated by SEM analysis. As shown in Fig. 3 , the Cu/ZnO_X catalysts exhibited different morphologies with the various aging times. During the aging step, Cu and Zn-related complex compounds could be crystallized from the amorphous precipitate and accordingly, the aging time is expected to affect the morphology of the Cu/ZnO catalyst. ZnO in the Cu/ZnO catalyst system seems to play an important role in increasing copper dispersion and providing a large number of exposed active sites to the reactant gas. In addition, it is believed that the aging time affects the morphology of ZnO and led to the diverse morphology of the reduced Cu/ZnO_X catalysts. The Cu/ZnO_10min catalyst exhibited a three-dimensional random network structure. As the aging time of the precipitate increased, a plate-like structure was mainly observed in the Cu/ZnO_1h catalyst, whereas the Cu/ZnO_5h and Cu/ZnO_10h catalysts exhibited a random mixture of both rod and plate-like structures. It seems that the Cu/ZnO_10min catalyst retained a three-dimensional random structure because the aging time of the precipitate was insufficient to form a particular morphology of Cu/ZnO catalysts. A plate-like structure of the Cu/ZnO_X catalyst was formed at an aging time of 1h and the plate-like structure then changed into a rod structure as the aging time was increased above 1h. From the SEM results, it can be inferred that the aging time of the precipitate strongly affected the morphology of Cu/ZnO_X catalysts, leading to their different catalytic performance in this reaction. 3.2 Catalytic performance The product analysis clearly revealed that methanol, methyl acetate, and ethyl acetate were produced in the liquid phase reaction. It is well known that ethyl acetate can be produced by the dehydrogenation of ethanol, which was employed as a solvent and reaction medium in this work, over a Cu/ZnO catalyst [36]. Therefore, ethyl acetate was not considered in the calculation of the selectivity and yield of this reaction. According to the mechanism of the alcohol-assisted low temperature methanol synthesis reaction, ethyl formate can be also produced as a by-product. However, ethyl formate was not produced in our catalytic reaction system over the Cu/ZnO_X catalysts. The yield for methanol increased with increasing aging time from 10min to 3h and then maintained a similar level beyond an aging time of 3h (Fig. 4 ). Accordingly, the Cu/ZnO_5h catalyst showed the highest catalytic performance in terms of methanol yield. As shown in Fig. 4, the selectivity for methyl acetate was analogous for all Cu/ZnO_X catalysts (ca. 9%) and the selectivity for methanol were almost constant (ca. 91%). This demonstrates that a sufficient aging time of the precipitate led to high catalytic activity in the alcohol-assisted low temperature methanol synthesis reaction. Considering the catalyst characterization and catalytic activity results, not only the copper particle size but also the morphology seem to affect the catalytic activity of the Cu/ZnO catalyst. It can be easily expected that Cu/ZnO catalysts with small copper particle size may be favorable for this reaction. Because, metallic copper is considered as a main active site for methanol synthesis from syngas. In this catalyst system, the copper crystallite size of the Cu/ZnO_X catalysts with an aging time more than 1h was found to be small enough to catalyze this reaction (Table 1). 3.3 Acid properties of the Cu/ZnO catalysts According to the mechanism reported by Tsubaki et al. [26], acid properties of catalysts can play a key role in the alcohol-assisted methanol synthesis. Because, the reaction pathway for alcohol-assisted low temperature methanol synthesis includes an alcohol esterification, which is regarded as the rate-limiting step in this reaction. It is generally accepted that the alcohol esterification can be easily catalyzed by acid sites of heterogeneous catalysts. Therefore, NH3-TPD measurements were conducted to investigate the effect of acid properties of the Cu/ZnO_X catalysts on their catalytic activity in this reaction. Fig. 5 (a) shows the NH3-TPD profile of the reduced Cu/ZnO_X catalysts, and peak deconvolution was conducted using a Gaussian profile as shown in Fig. 5(b). The acidities of the Cu/ZnO_X catalysts are summarized in Table 2 . There were three types of acid sites in the Cu/ZnO_X catalysts. The weak acid site was identified as NH3 desorbed in the temperature range of 150–200°C. The NH3 desorption peak in the range of 250–350°C corresponds to the medium acid site and the temperature peak in the range of 400–500°C was denoted as the strong acid site. As shown in Fig. 5, Cu/ZnO_X catalysts retained different amounts of acid sites depending on the aging time of the precipitate. Among the prepared catalysts, the Cu/ZnO_5h catalyst retained the highest amount of strong acid sites, which may lead to the high methanol selectivity and yield in the alcohol-assisted low temperature methanol synthesis reaction. In order to clarify the effect of the amount of strong acid sites of the Cu/ZnO_X catalysts and the catalytic activity, the correlation between the methanol yield and the amount of strong acid sites was evaluated (Fig. 6 ). As shown in Fig. 6, the yield for methanol increased monotonically with an increasing amount of strong acid sites of the catalyst; this correlation clearly indicates that the strong acidity of the Cu/ZnO catalyst played a key role in the alcohol-assisted low temperature methanol synthesis. It is thought that the strong acid sites of the Cu/ZnO catalyst may catalyze the crucial step of this reaction. Based on the results from this work and the mechanism reported by Tsubaki et al. [26], we proposed the reaction pathway for the alcohol-assisted low temperature methanol synthesis reaction over the Cu/ZnO catalysts (Fig. 7 ). It is well known that the water gas shift reaction (WGS) easily occurs over the Cu/ZnO catalyst from carbon monoxide and water. Activated formate and hydrogen can be easily formed over a copper-based catalyst and the acid sites of the Cu/ZnO catalyst can then catalyze the ethanol esterification, which is the rate-determining step for this reaction. As shown in Fig. 7, ethanol acts as both the solvent and a reaction intermediate. Thus, ethanol can promote the low temperature methanol synthesis reaction in this work. According to the proposed reaction pathway for the alcohol-assisted low temperature methanol synthesis over the Cu/ZnO catalyst, methanol, methyl acetate, and ethyl formate can be produced. However, only methanol and methyl acetate were produced in the liquid products because of the sufficient amount of acid sites of the prepared Cu/ZnO_X catalyst. It is also known that ethyl acetate is easily formed from the dehydrogenation of ethanol over copper catalysts [36]. Considering the considerable base sites from ZnO, it is assumed that the ethyl acetate obtained by ethanol dehydrogenation was easily converted to methyl acetate by the transesterification reaction. A majority of researchers in this research field agree with that ZnO have a main function on the stabilization effect for maintaining a high copper dispersion in the Cu/ZnO catalyst system [31,32]. However, we need to take a note that this catalytic reaction is not a conventional methanol synthesis but an alcohol-assisted low temperature methanol synthesis. According to the proposed reaction pathway (Fig. 7), acid and base properties from ZnO with the stabilization effect should be carefully considered for obtaining an efficient Cu/ZnO catalyst for this reaction. Therefore, we assume that synthesizing Cu/ZnO catalysts developing with high copper dispersion, at the same time, with appropriate acid and base properties is one of the most important technologies in this catalytic reaction. From the reaction pathway, It is obvious that not only the metallic copper but also the strong acid sites of Cu/ZnO catalysts played important roles in the alcohol-assisted low temperature methanol synthesis reaction. Therefore, it is believed that the aging time of the precipitate for preparation of Cu/ZnO catalysts by a co-precipitation method had a strong influence on both the copper particle size and the strong acidity of catalysts, leading to different catalytic activities of Cu/ZnO catalysts with a variation of aging time. Sufficient aging time was required to prepare the Cu/ZnO catalyst with a small copper crystalline size and a high strong acidity, and accordingly, to obtain an efficient Cu/ZnO catalyst for alcohol-assisted low temperature methanol synthesis. 3.4 Catalytic stability Catalyst characterization was carried out to determine the catalytic stability of the Cu/ZnO catalyst before and after the catalyst reaction. The Cu/ZnO_5h catalyst was chosen as a model catalyst to carry out the alcohol-assisted low temperature reaction for 20h. The structural stability of the Cu/ZnO_5h catalyst during the catalytic reaction was also confirmed in the XRD patterns obtained before and after the catalytic reaction. As shown in Fig. 8 , no changes of the XRD patterns of Cu/ZnO_5h catalyst before and after catalytic reaction were observed. In addition, the crystallite size of the Cu/ZnO_5h catalyst was similar before and after the catalytic reaction, while no XRD peaks of copper oxide were observed. This XRD result indicates that no crystalline structure changes occurred during the catalytic reaction. ICP-AES analysis was conducted to evaluate leaching during the catalytic reaction. The molar ratios of Cu/Zn in the Cu/ZnO_5h catalyst before and after the catalytic reaction were determined to be near 1. This result demonstrates that no loss of metal components took place during the catalytic reaction. In addition, no significant change of the specific surface area of Cu/ZnO_5h before and after the catalytic reaction was observed. From the characterization results of the Cu/ZnO_5h catalyst before and after catalytic reaction, it was demonstrated that the Cu/ZnO_5h catalyst was stable during the catalytic reaction. Therefore, we expect that the Cu/ZnO_5h catalyst prepared in this work could be applied to a continuous methanol production from syngas using a CSTR reactor. 4 Conclusion Cu/ZnO_X catalysts were prepared by a co-precipitation method with various aging times (X) of the precipitate. The prepared catalysts were applied to alcohol-assisted low temperature methanol synthesis (LTMS) from syngas. In this study, ethanol was employed as both the solvent and reaction intermediate. Successful formation of the Cu/ZnO_X catalysts was verified by XRD, ICP-AES, and N2 adsorption-desorption analyses. The aging time of the precipitate in the co-precipitation step significantly affected the properties of the Cu/ZnO catalysts and their catalytic activity. The selectivity of methanol was maintained at a similar level (ca. 93%) while the yield for methanol continuously increased up to an aging time of 1h, maintaining similar values up to 10h. The characterization revealed that the small copper crystalline size and the high strong acidity of the Cu/ZnO catalysts were favorable for the alcohol-assisted low temperature methanol synthesis. Unlike the conventional methanol production, it was revealed that not only the intrinsic activity of metallic copper but also the acid properties of catalysts should be carefully considered in this reaction. Especially, the yield for methanol increased monotonically with increasing the strong acid sites of the catalyst in this reaction. Consequently, sufficient aging time was required to prepare the Cu/ZnO catalyst with a small copper crystalline size and a high strong acidity, and accordingly, to obtain an efficient Cu/ZnO catalyst for methanol synthesis. The Cu/ZnO_5h catalyst, which showed the highest catalytic performance in this reaction, retained a structural stability even after the 20h-catalytic reaction. The crystalline structure and molar ratio of the Cu/ZnO_5h catalyst before and after the catalytic reaction exhibited no changes. Therefore, the Cu/ZnO_5h catalyst is expected to serve as an efficient catalyst for a continuous methanol production from using a CSTR reaction system.
