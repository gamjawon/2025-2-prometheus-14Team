One of the effective ways is to incorporate one or more additives to the copper/zinc oxide binary or copper/zinc oxide/alumina ternary catalysts such as boron, chromium, manganese, rare earths, vanadium, cesium and zirconium [2-4]. Attractive results have been claimed. For example, according to Nunan et al. [3], doping with cesium was shown to give rise to over a two-fold increase in methanol yield on the copper/zinc oxide binary catalyst with the selectivity for methanol better than 98.9 mol.% for all cesium contents used (0.1-2.1 mol.%). The doping effects of cesium are thought to stem from the increase of the concentration and reactivity of surface hydroxyl groups and thereby the promo- tion of the formation of intermediate formate. Sheffer et al. systematically investigated the effect of doping with alkali metals on methanol formation rate over unsupported copper catalysts and a 5-70-fold increase in the surface area normalized activity was observed. The NMR results indicate that the promotion effect of the alkali metals is to stabilize the Cut phase by forming carbonates with a general formula CuCO3 (M = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) [5-7]. In view of the practical applications, the effect of doping with potassium permanganate on the performance of a copper/zinc oxide/alumina catalyst ternary catalyst was studied. The preliminary reason for the promotion effect of potassium permanganate was examined using atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray-induced Auger transi- tion, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and temperature programmed oxidation (TPO). 2. Experimental The precursor of the undoped catalyst was prepared by simultaneous addition of a mixed aqueous solution of copper, zinc and aluminum nitrates with a total concentration of 1.0 mol/l and an aqueous solution of sodium carbonate (1.0 mol/1) into a beaker containing a small amount of deionized water. The suspension in the beaker was continuously stirred and kept at a pH range of 7.0 + 0.2 and a temperature range of 70 + 2 by adjusting the relative flow rate of the two liquids and the heating power. After precipitation, the suspension was maintained at the same temperature range for 0.5 h to complete the aging step. The precipitate was washed and then dried at 80 for at least 16 h. The final stage of the calcination of the precursor was carried out at 350 in an atmosphere of air for 6 h. The nominal mole fraction of copper, zinc and aluminum in the catalyst was 0.6, 0.3 and 0.1, respectively. The doped catalysts were made by dissolving potassium permanganate in the mixed aqueous solution of the nitrates of copper, zinc and aluminum and then following the other procedures in the preparation of the undoped catalyst. J.-L. Li et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 139 (1996) 97-106 99 The washing procedure for all the catalyst precursors was exactly the same so that the fraction of the additive remained in the catalysts was roughly the same. For convenience, the KMnO4-doped catalysts are designated as KM,,, where n indicates the nominal dosage of potassium permanganate in mol.%. The undoped catalyst is designated as KM0. To meet the needs of qualitative and quantitative analyses by XRD, two pure samples were also prepared: malachite and Cu,Zn-hydrotalcite. The conditions and procedures in the preparation of the two samples were the same as those in the preparation of the precursor of KM0 but the mole ratios of copper, zinc and aluminum in the nitrate solution were different. In case of malachite, it was 1:0:0, while in case of Cu,Zn-hydrotalcite, it was 3:3:2, which is just the stoichiometric composition of Cu,Zn-hydrotalcite, Cu3Zn3AI2(OH)~6CO3 4H20, and a favorable ratio for the formation of it. The catalytic performance of the catalysts for methanol synthesis were evaluated with a fixed-bed flow reactor system at 20 bar, 225 and a space velocity of 7000 ml/gcat h. 1.8 g catalyst particles of 15-24 mesh were charged into the reactor. The composition of the gas feed was CO/CO2/H2 = 30.5:3.05:66.45 (mol.%). Before reaction, the catalysts were reduced under normal pressure by passing the feed gas at a space velocity of 7000 ml/g cat h. The heating procedure of the catalyst bed was as follows: heating up from room temperature to 120 at a rate of 4/min; allowing to stand at 120 for 1.5 h; and finally, heating up to 225 at a rate of l/min. The whole reduction procedure took about 4 h. This procedure was proved to be effective for a bench scale evaluation of the copper/zinc oxide/alumina catalysts without an induc- tion period. The product stream was analyzed in-line without condensation by a chromatograph equipped with two columns (filled with activated carbon and Porpack Y respectively) and two kinds of detectors (TCD and FID). The XRD measurement was carried out by using an SD-D1 X-ray powder diffractometer (Cu K a radiation) equipped with a DP-D1 computer system to perform automatic operation and data processing. A DTG-40 thermal analyzer was used to record the DTA and TG patterns of the precursors simultaneously in a flow of 4% oxygen in nitrogen at a heating rate of 10/min. The thermal analyzer was also used in the TPO (temperature programmed oxidation) and TG measurements of the catalysts in 5% oxygen in nitrogen at the same heating rate as used in the DTA measurement. Before the TPO experiment, the catalysts were reduced with 4% hydrogen in nitrogen at a heating rate of 10/rain up to 500 from room temperature. In order to determine the real dosage of potassium and manganese in the catalysts, AAS was applied. The X-ray photoelectron spectra and X-ray-induced transitions were deter- mined with a Multiplex ESCA system. The reduced catalysts were obtained by heating the samples at a rate of 10/min from room temperature to 500 while passing 4% hydrogen in 100 J.-L.

Results and discussion 3.1. Catalyst performance Fig. 1 plots the methanol yield expressed in STY and the selectivity to methanol as a function of the nominal dosage of potassium permanganate. When the nominal dosage was below 3 mol.%, the yield rose abruptly with the increasing dosage. It was almost unchanged in the dosage range between 3 and 12%. When the dosage exceeded 12%, the STY of methanol dropped slowly with the rising dosage. The greatest improvement at the dosage of 6% gave rise to a 20% increase in methanol yield.

Atomic absorption spectroscopy Table 1 reports the real bulk contents of potassium and manganese deter- mined with AAS in the catalysts doped with a different amount of potassium permanganate. It is obvious that most of the potassium permanganate added to the solution of the mixed nitrates was washed away from the precipitates and more manganese than potassium was left. Those mean that neither potassium nor manganese entered the lattice of the precipitates. They were entrained and adsorbed by the precipitates and manganese present in anions was more strongly adsorbed than potassium as cations probably due to the different electrostatic force. According to Nunan et al., the minimum content of cesium which resulted in an appreciable promotion for methanol synthesis over copper/zinc oxide binary catalysts was higher than 0.1 mol.% [3]. The minimum dosage of potassium used by Sheffer was 1.2 mol.% for the unsupported methanol synthesis copper catalysts [5]. So it is unlikely that so small contents of potassium ( < 0.005%) in our KMnO4-doped catalysts would exert any influence on the catalyst perfor- mance. So it is reasonable to suppose that it was manganese that provided a promotional effect on the performance of the copper/zinc oxide/alumina catalyst for methanol synthesis. 3.3.

The XRD patterns of the other KMnO4- doped catalysts are very similar, so they are left out. The peak positions in the XRD patterns of the precursors of both KMo and KM]2 are very similar to those of the mixture of pure malachite and Cu,Zn-hydrotalcite except for the apprecia- ble shifts of the two peaks at 20 equal to 31.29 and 32.19 deg ascribed to malachite towards greater angles, which implies a decrease in the interplanar spacings of planes 210, 140 and 110, 021 from 2.857 and 2.780 A for malachite to 2.800 and 2.724 A for KM0 resulted by the substitution of zinc for copper. This indicates that the precursors of KM0 and KM12 consisted of only two phases: Cu,Zn-malachite and Cu,Zn-hydrotalcite. Besides, the data from the quantitative analysis by XRD demonstrate that the contents of Cu,Zn-hydro- talcite in the precursors of the undoped catalyst and all the KMnO4-doped catalysts were within a narrow range of 40 + 3 mol.%. So it can be concluded that the doping effect of potassium permanganate was not caused by the variation of the phase composition of the precursors. The XRD patterns of the calcined and syngas-treated KM0 and KM12 are shown in Fig. 3. Only poorly crystallized copper(II) oxide and zinc oxide could be observed in the calcined catalysts. After being treated with syngas, copper(II) oxide disappeared and copper metal became the main phase of copper with zinc oxide remaining unchanged. The fact that no unambiguous peaks of copper(I) oxide were present indicates that the content of copper(I) oxide in the bulk of the catalysts was very low. But it cannot be concluded that its content was lower J.-L.

Since no aluminum phases were observed in any of the calcined or syngas-treated catalysts, the aluminum phases (probably alumina) is concluded to be in a quasi-amorphous and/or amorphous states. The facts that no copper(II) oxide and no much copper(I) oxide existed in the syngas-treated catalysts have proved that the passivation method we used is effective for the preparation of samples in a reduced state for physicochemical characterization. 3.4. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy Table 2 shows the surface composition of the undoped catalyst, KM0, and the catalyst doped with 12% potassium permanganate, KMI2, in three different states: calcined, reduced and syngas-treated ones by XPS. According to Lloyd et al. [8], when the precipitation is carried out at the pH value of around 7 as in our case, copper, zinc and aluminum in the solution can precipitate completely. Therefore, the actual bulk composition of the catalyst is the same as the nominal one with copper/zinc/aluminum ratio being 6:3:1 for all the catalysts con- cerned in this paper. It can be seen from Table 2 that the surface contents of copper, zinc and aluminum significantly differ from the bulk contents. The fraction of aluminum in the total metals on the surface was about 63% for calcined KMo. This means a more than 5-fold increase compared with the bulk content. This phenomenon was even more severe for the reduced and syngas- treated KM0. The situation for KM12 was similar. The zinc/copper ratio on the surface of the both catalysts was also higher than that in the bulk. Another interesting fact is that although the content of nitrogen on the surface (according to the N 1 s banding energy of around 407.5 eV measured by XPS, it existed in a form of nitrate) was quite high, the catalysts are still highly active and selective. This indicates that the survived nitrate does not deteriorate the catalyst performance appreciably. This is very important because the ions adsorbed on the high surface area of a fine precipitate is difficult to remove by 104 J.-L.

X-ray-induced Auger transitions for the syngas-treated KM0 (a) and KM 12 (b). washing with water. For example, the precipitates of both KM0 and KM12 were washed as many as 8 times but still insufficiently. Comparing the concentration of oxygen on the surface of KM0 and KM~2, it can be concluded that on the KMnO4-doped catalyst, the concentration of surface oxygen was higher than that on the undoped catalyst for all the three different states of the catalyst. The banding energy of the O ls peak (529.3-530.3 eV) indicates that the surface oxygen were in the form of metal oxides. The KMnO4-doped catalysts may adsorb hydrogen to form more surface hydroxyl which reacts with carbon monoxide and produce intermediate formate species. The formate species then hydrogenates to form methanol and surface hydroxyl is regenerated [3,9,10]. The decrease in activity of KM~8 may be resulted from the excessive doping which poisons the hydrogenation function of the catalyst. The X-ray photoelectron spectra of the calcined KMo and KM~2 were very similar. The binding energy of 932.9 eV for 2p3/2 can be ascribed to Cu2+ species. A satellite peak at 941.3 eV is also indicative of Cu2+. The reduced and syngas-treated KMo and KMI2 were found to have 2P3/2 binding energies of 1+ 0 931.4-931.8 eV which can be assigned to either Cu or Cu [4]. Besides, the satellite peak disappeared. To distinguish Cu~+ and Cu the X-ray-induced Auger transitions for the syngas-treated KMo and KM 12 are shown in Fig. 4 in which a modified Auger parameter defined by ce + hv = KELMM -- KE2P3/2 + hu was used. KELMM and KEzP3/2 are the kinetic energies of the L3M45M45 X-ray-induced Auger emitted electrons and the 2P3/2 photoemitted electron respectively. The syngas-treated two catalysts showed two peaks at 1848.7 and 1850.7 eV which can be ascribed to Cu~ + and Curespectively [4]. The contents of Cu1 + J.-L.

TPO patterns of KMII (a), KM1 (b), KM~ (c), KM6 (d), KMI~ (e)and KMIs (f). on the surface of the two syngas-treated catalysts were considerably high. Considering also the fact that the bulk concentrations of Cu~ + were very low as indicated by the XRD results described previously, it can be concluded that Cu~ ~ was concentrated on the catalyst surface rather than in the bulk. It is also seen that the relative intensity of Cu~ + and Cufor KMI2 is greater than that for KM0. This means that there would be more Cu~ + on the surface of KM,2 than on the surface of KM0 under reaction conditions and therefore explains why the KMnOa-doped catalysts were more active and selective since Cu~ + has been regarded as the active center for methanol synthesis with an increasing indica- tion [ 11 ]. 3.5. Temperature programmed oxidation The affinity of the KMnO4-doped catalysts for oxygen was also confirmed by the TPO results as shown in Fig. 5. Along with the increasing dosage of potassium permanganate, the first peak in the TPO patterns grew more intensive. This implies that the content of the most easily oxidized site of the catalysts 106 J.-L. Li et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 139 (1996) 97-106 increased with the increase of the dosage of KMnO4 and therefore more Cu~ + might exist in the KMnO4-doped catalysts than in the undoped one under reaction conditions and with the increase of the dosage, the amount of CuI + became greater. 4. Conclusions (1) The activity and selectivity of the doped copper/zinc oxide/alumina ternary catalysts for methanol synthesis are enhanced by doping with potassium permanganate and it is more likely that manganese is responsible for this enhancement. (2) The optimum nominal dosage of potassium permanganate was found to be 6.0 mol.%. (3) The nature of the promotion effect of manganese is suggested to be the increased affinity of the catalyst surface for oxygen which gives rise to increased surface oxygen and Cu~ + species under reaction conditions.

        "dc:description": "The doping effect of potassium permanganate on the performance of a copper/zinc oxide/alumina catalyst for methanol synthesis was studied. It was found that doping with potassium permanganate appreciably enhanced the activity of the catalyst. The optimum nominal dosage of potassium permanganate was found to be 6.0 mol.%. The precursors and the calcined, reduced and syngas-treated catalysts undoped and doped with potassium permanganate were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray-induced Auger transition, powder X-ray diffraction, atomic absorption spectroscopy and temperature programmed oxidation. Based on the results of the characterzation, it is suggested that the promotion effect is mainly caused by manganese and the nature of the effect is probably the increased affinity of the catalyst surface for oxygen which gives rise to increased surface oxygen and Cu1+ species under reaction conditions.",
