Graphical abstract Hydrogen production from dry reforming of methane (DRM) over chief Ni-based catalyst is cutting edge research area due to environmental consciousness about reducing global warming gases (CH4 and CO2) and greener route of synthesis. Herein, ceria promoted lanthanum-zirconia supported Ni catalyst system (5NixCe/LaZr; x = 0, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 5 wt.%) is prepared by the wet impregnation method. It is further characterized using X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet spectroscopy, temperature-programmed and cyclic temperature-programmed experiments. 2.5 wt.% ceria promoted lanthana-zirconia supported Ni catalyst (5Ni2.5Ce/LaZr) has thermally stabilized the support, wide Ni-LaZr interface for CH4 decomposition, wide basic surfaces (La2O3-ZrO2) for CO2 interaction, CO2 coordinated La+3 sites (as La2O2CO3 species), low band gap and oxygen vacancy carrying mobile oxygen (which is replenished by CO2). Altogether, it produces more than 87 % hydrogen yield. This thorough study and fine correlation will help design industrially suitable catalyst for hydrogen production through DRM. Keywords Ceria promotion DRM La2O3-ZrO2 supported Ni H2-production Temperature programmed cyclic experiments 1 Introduction Hydrogen is a clean and green source of energy. It is produced from biomass pyrolysis, biomass gasification [1], ethanol [2], glycerol [3], glucose [4], starch and catechol [5] through either stream or thermal reforming. Albeit, hydrogen production through clean sources as methane over a heterogeneous catalyst is highly demanded due to environmental concern, atom economy and easy separation of H2 from the product mixture. Thermal reforming of methane [6–8], steam reforming of methane [9] and dry (CO2) reforming of methane are some popular choice for hydrogen production. Hydrogen production from dry reforming of methane (DRM) belongs to cutting edge research which opens the hope of the efficient conversion of two global warmings gas CO2 and CH4 together. Among heterogeneous catalysts, Pt [10], Ru [11], Rh [12] and Ni-based catalyst system was found efficient in hydrogen production. In recent year, cheap Ni-based catalyst system has drawn most of the attention in this field. However, under highly endothermic DRM reaction, Ni undergoes serious aggregation and loss its catalytic property. So, the Ni-supported system is indeed a successful catalytic route for hydrogen production. Ni supported on SiO2, Al2O3 and ZrO2 were found promising for H2 production through DRM. All three supports can sustain the high-temperature reaction condition for DRM. The possible activation of CO2 at Ni/Zr interface [13] as well as inducing Ni dispersion through the anchoring effect of Zr4+ species [14] makes ZrO2 support specific than SiO2 and Al2O3. Apart from that, the redox behaviour of ZrO2 makes it superior than that of irreducible SiO2 and Al2O3 support. Redox behaviour enables the support to release oxygen for possible carbon deposit oxidation [12,15–17]. Further addition of modifier/promoter in zirconia supported Ni catalyst system was found to enhance the catalytic activity. A brief literature survey of promotor/modifier utilized over zirconia supported Ni catalysts is shown in Table 1 . Research activity for preparing Ni dispersed catalyst over binary metal/non-metal oxide is also noticed in tuning acid-basic property or thermal stability [33,34]. La2O3 also has potent redox chemistry with La2O3/La2O2CO3 set [35–37]. It will be interesting to observe the effect of the strong synergy between La2O3-ZrO2 if used to support the Ni dispersed system. Presence of La2O3 may also influence CO2 adsorption (due to its basic property) [38] and Ni-support interaction [39,40] & NiO size optimization [41,42] whereas it may inhibit H2 consumption through RWGS reaction [43,44]. Tou et al.; have prepared nickel impregnated La2O3-ZrO2 via a sol-gel method for dry reforming of coke oven gas and observed great coke resistance property [44]. Further addition of a small amount of CeO2 in the catalyst system enhances lattice oxygen mobility, which is beneficial in eliminating carbon [45]. The synergistic role of La-Ce was also claimed as guaranteed catalyst tolerance against carbon deposition as well as lattice oxygen replenishment for the oxidation reaction [46]. Overall, we can expect as good carbon resistant and high H2 yield with ceria promoted La2O3-ZrO2 supported Ni catalytic system. It is generally accepted that H2 production (yield) through DRM is greatly driven by dissociation of CH4 over Ni-supported surface followed by subsequent gasification of carbon deposit by CO2 for cleaning the surface for the next set of CH4 decomposition reaction (CH4 + CO2 → CO + H2). Later gasification of carbon deposit by H2 due to spillover effect of hydrogen on the surface (C + 2H2 → CH4) [47] as well as reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction (CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O) affects the H2 yield seriously. However, gasification of carbon deposit by water (as a product of RWGS) has a positive contribution in H2 yield. Herein, we have prepared a lanthanum-zirconia supported Ni catalyst system and is further promoted by 1–5 % ceria. This catalytic system is employed for hydrogen production through DRM. It is characterized via X-ray diffraction, Infrared spectroscopy, Ultraviolet spectroscopy, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR), temperature-programmed hydrogenation (TPH), temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) and cyclic temperature-programmed experiments, i.e. CH4-TPSR, H2TPR-CO2TPD-H2TPR cycle, CO2TPD-O2TPO cycle and TPH-O2TPO cycle. A fine correlation is established between characterization results and catalytic activity. This study will be helpful to design industrially robust catalyst for hydrogen production through dry reforming of methane. The objective of the research is to explore the surface catalytic excellence of Ce promoted Lanthana-Zirconia supported Ni catalyst system for hydrogen production through DRM by X-ray diffraction, Infrared & Ultra-violet spectroscopy, different temperature-programmed experiments & cyclic temperature-programmed experiments. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Ni (NO3)2.6H2O (98 %) was purchased from Riedel-De Haen AG, Seelze, Germany, Ce (NO3)3.6H2O was purchased Williams Ltd, Essex, England, respectively. The support, La2O3+ZrO2, was obtained as a gift from Daiichi Kigenso Kagaku Kogyo Co., Ltd. Osaka – Japan. 2.2 Catalyst preparation The catalyst was synthesized via wet impregnation method as described in our earlier work [66]. Weighted amount of Ni (NO3)2.6H2O equivalent to 5.0 wt. % loading of nickel was dissolved in an aqueous medium. Weighted amount of Ce (NO3)3.6H2O corresponding to 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 5.0 wt. % loading of cerium was added to the nickel nitrate aqueous solution. Further, the support 9 wt%La2O3+91wt%ZrO2 was added to the aqueous mixture under stirring at 80 °C. The slurry was dried at 120 ℃ overnight in an oven and subsequently calcined in air at 600 ℃ for 3 h. Zirconia supported Ni catalyst, 1 % ceria promoted zirconia supported Ni catalyst, lanthana-zirconia supported Ni catalyst and 1–3 % ceria promoted lanthana-zirconia supported Ni catalyst are abbreviated as 5Ni/Zr, 5Ni1Ce/Zr, 5Ni/LaZr, 5NixCe/LaZr (where; x = 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 5). 2.3 Catalyst characterization Catalysts are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Infra-red spectroscopy, Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV–vis), CH4-Temperature programmed surface reaction (CH4-TPSR), H2-temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), CO2-Temperature programmed desorption (CO2-TPD), temperature-programmed hydrogenation (TPH) and O2-Temperature programmed oxidation (O2-TPO). The details specification of the instrument and characterization procedure are given in supporting information (S1). 2.4 Catalyst activity test The dry reforming of methane experiments was carried over 0.1 g of Ce promoted 5%Ni/La2O3+ZrO2 catalyst at 700 ℃ under 1 atm pressure in stainless steel vertical fixed tubular reactor (PID Eng. & Tech Micro Activity Reference, 9.1 mm i.d. and 30 cm long). The catalysts were positioned by the help of a ball of glass wool during activity tests. The temperature of the reactor was monitored by an axially positioned thermocouple (K-type stainless sheathed) at the center of the catalyst bed. Before the catalytic tests, reductive pretreatment of catalyst samples was carried out under the flow of hydrogen (20 mL/min) for 60 min at 600 ℃. The mixture of gases feed CH4/CO2/N2 in the respective volumes as 6:6:2, and the volume flow rate was 70 mL.min−1 and 42,000 mL(h.gcat)−1 gas hourly space velocity was passed through the reactor. The product gas stream was analyzed by GC (GC-2014 Shimadzu) unit equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and two columns, Porapak Q and Molecular Sieve 5A. H2 yield % and H2/CO molar ratio are determined by the following expressions: H 2 Y i e l d % = M o l e o f H 2 i n p r o d u c t 2 x m o l o f C H 4 i n × 100 H 2 C O = M o l e s o f H 2 p r o d u c e d M o l e s o f C O p r o d u c e d 3 Result and discussion 3.1 Catalytic activity results The catalytic activity results in terms of H2 yield is shown in Fig. 1 . Zirconia supported Ni catalysts are efficient to produce hydrogen with a 43 % yield. After adding the ceria promoter (5Ni1Ce/Zr), a rise in H2 yield (47 %) was noticed. However, a marked increase of H2 yield about 80 % was only noticed if lanthana-zirconia support was used in place of only zirconia support. 5Ni/LaZr catalyst showed 80 % H2 yield. Further promotional effect of ceria was also noticed up to 2.5 % Ceria addition. 5Ni1Ce/LaZr, 5Ni1.5 Ce/LaZr and 5Ni2Ce/LaZr showed 82 %, 85 % and 91 % H2 yield, respectively. Our target was to find out a catalytic system composition that has both high and stable performance toward H2 yield. 5Ni2.5Ce/LaZr catalyst retained 86–87 % H2 yield up to more than 420 min. 2.5 % ceria loading was found to be the optimum loading in term of catalytic activity. Further increases in ceria loading caused a drop in H2 yield; however, the activity of the catalysts remains stable. 5Ni3Ce/LaZr and 5Ni5Ce/LaZr showed 81–82 % and 80–81 % H2 yield up to more than 420 min of reaction, respectively. H2/CO ratio of all ceria promoted lanthana-zirconia supported Ni catalyst system are found close to 1 (Fig S2). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) analysis shows decreased carbon deposits over the catalyst surface with increasing ceria loading (Fig. S3). 3.2 Characterization results The XRD profiles of spent catalysts of 5NixCe/Zr (x = 0, 1) are shown in (Fig. 2 (A)). Spent zirconia supported Ni (Spent 5Ni/Zr) catalyst shows monoclinic zirconium oxide phase (space group: P21/C, JCPDS no. 00-007-0343), crystalline carbon phases (space group: P63mc, JCPDS no. 01-075-1621) and cubic nickel oxide phase (space group: Fm3m, JCPDS no. 01-073-1519, 2θ = 37.32° at 111 plane, 2θ = 43.57° at 200 plane; 2θ = 62.92° at 220 plane). It indicates that zirconia support is prone to crystalline carbon deposition during the DRM reaction. Ceria promoted catalyst system is known to be coke resistance due to prompt mobile oxygen availability for coke oxidation. Ceria promoted spent catalyst (spent 5Ni1Ce/ZrO2) had minimum carbon phases, but it had prominent defective zirconia oxides phase as ZrO1.96 (monoclinic Zirconium oxide, space group: P21/C, JCPDS no. 01-081-1319) and Zr0.93O2 (cubic Zirconium oxide, space group: Fm3m, JCPDS no. 01-081-1551). That means ceria promotional addition caused rapid wash away of crystalline carbon (by oxidation of deposit).) Overall, defective zirconia and phase transformation of zirconia phase from monoclinic to cubic zirconia at high-temperature condition limits the high catalytic performance of this catalytic system. Overall, zirconia was not a good support, and some phase stabilizer is curiously needed for higher catalytic performance. The XRD profile of 5NixCe/LaZr (x = 0, 1) are shown in (Fig. 2(B)–(F)). After mixing lanthanum in zirconia support, no such defective phases and phase transformations were noticed (Fig. 2(B)). It indicates that lanthana stabilized the zirconia phase and now lanthana-zirconia became a good catalytic support for a high-temperature DRM reaction. However, in all spent catalyst system; hexagonal lanthanum oxide phase (Space group: P-3m1, JCPDS no. 01-083-1345; 2θ = 25.51° 100 plane, 2θ = 29.37° at 011 plane) was noticed. It indicates that the La2O3 phase crystallized during the high-temperature reaction. Spent 5Ni/LaZr catalyst also showed intense NiO peak at 37.32° than that without lanthana catalyst. It also an indication of poor NiO dispersion after the reaction. To resolve this issue, a small addition of ceria was found beneficial. After promotional addition of ceria in this catalyst system, spent 5Ni1Ce/LaZr showed tetragonal cerium zirconia oxide peaks (Space group: P4212, JCPDS no. 00-026-0359; 2θ = 29.46° at 002 plane, 2θ = 34.31° at 102 planes; 2θ = 49.34° at 212 plane) and diffused NiO crystallite peaks. It indicates that the presence of ceria or ceria-zirconia mixed oxide enhances the NiO dispersion and control the size of NiO during the high-temperature DRM reaction. The XRD profiles lanthana-zirconia sample had zirconia oxide phases, but not the lanthanum oxide phase. It indicates that lanthanum oxide is well dispersed. After NiO addition, the cubic NiO diffraction peaks appeared at 2θ = 37.32° and 43.57° (Fig. 2(C)). Moreover, after the reaction; zirconium oxide diffraction peak intensity was suppressed predominantly, lanthanum oxide (01-083-1345) diffraction peak appeared, and NiO peaks about (111) intensified. After addition of ceria to “lanthana-zirconia supported Ni system”, a marginal rise of zirconia oxide peaks was noticed, but no significant changes were noticed in the mean crystallite size of NiO (Fig. 2 (E) and (F)). After the reaction, the lanthanum oxide (01-083-1345) peak appeared whereas zirconium oxide as well as NiO peaks, were suppressed. It indicates that ceria does not influence NiO dispersion during catalyst preparation, but during the high-temperature DRM reaction, its presence is essential for high dispersion of NiO. The Infra-red spectroscopy (IR) absorption bands about 3,425 and 1,625 cm−1 were found in all samples which are attributed to stretching and bending vibration of OH, respectively Fig. 3 . Physically adsorbed CO2 gas showed an IR absorption band at 2,349 cm−1 [48,49]. The IR spectra of ZrO2 shows absorption bands at 748 and 500 cm−1 which are for stretching vibration of Zr-O [50–52] whereas IR spectra of La2O3 shows a characteristic absorption band at 3,608 cm−1 for stretching vibration of OH and 640 cm−1 for bending vibration of OH group at surface of La2O3 and peak at 3,450 cm−1 is due to La(O)OH species (Fig. 3(A)). absorption bands at 1,464, 1,370, 1,084 and 859 cm−1 are attributed to La2O2CO3 species. Among which absorption bands at 1,464 and 859 cm−1 are due to CO3 2− symmetric stretching, vibration belongs to the pure form of typical ionic anhydrous lanthanum carbonate (La2(CO3)3) [52,53]. The absorption band at 1370 cm−1 is due to “oxycarbonate strongly coordinated with La3+” (La2O3.CO2). The absorption band due to the symmetric stretch vibration of CO3 2- is infrared inactive for free ion case, but in the lattice, it became active and gave an FTIR band at 1084 cm−1 due to change of D3h symmetry of free ion to lower symmetry C2v or Cs [54]. This peak was selected to estimate the proportional amount of La2O2CO3 species because it gave only one band in the hexagonal polymorph form of La2O2CO3 [55]. The FTIR signal of La-Zr samples shows the disappearance of the absorption band of 748 cm−1 for ZrO, 3608 and 640 cm− 1 for OH group vibration at the surface of La2O3. It indicates that the bonding between atoms was greatly modified and isolated identity ZrO2 and La2O3 were lost. The absorption band at 3450 cm−1 is due to La(O)OH species and was either disappeared or merged with hydroxyl peaks of zirconia/Lanthana-zirconia interface. As ZrO2 was present in major quantity, so peaks due to vibration of OH were preserved at 3425 and 1625 cm−1. Absorption bands at 1084 and 1370 cm−1 for “oxycarbonate strongly coordinated with La3+” in La2O2CO3 species were also found in La-Zr samples whereas peak due to anhydrous lanthanum carbonate (La2(CO3)3) were disappeared. Small new absorption bands also appeared below 800 cm−1 due to La-O-La and La-O-Zr [56]. If IR spectra was taken after CO2-TPD of 4Ni1CeLaZr sample, the absorption band of physically adsorbed CO2 (2349 cm−1) had increased, but absorption band due to surface hydroxyl (3425 and 1625 cm−1) and La2O2CO3 species (1084 and 1370 cm−1) also decreased. It indicates that at high-temperature reaction condition these species were present over catalyst surface. The FTIR signal of “ceria promoted Lanthana-Zirconia supported Ni catalyst” shows the disappearance of 1084 cm−1 absorption bands of La2O2CO3 species concerning only “Lanthana-Zirconia supported Ni catalyst” Fig. 3(B). However, as ceria loading increased from 1 % to 2 %, it appeared again. It is remarkable that as ceria loading increased absorption bands of OH vibration and peaks due to La2O2CO3, they were increasing. It indicates that ceria addition influences the surface hydroxyl as well as La2O2CO3 population. Pure ZrO2 shows the UV band at 226 and 280 nm due to charge transfer from the 2p energy state of O (valence band) to 4d (x2-y2, z2) energy state of Zr (conduction band) (Fig. 4 (A)). It is simply represented as charge transition O2− to Zr+4 [57,58]. Because Zr has d° configuration, so no characteristic peak for d-d transition was found. It shows a band gap of 5.14 eV (Fig. 4(B)). After the addition of 9% Lanthana in Zirconia, the UV band at 226 nm was demolished completely. It indicates perturbance of charge transfer from O2− to M+n system. The band gap of the lanthana-zirconia system was found at 5.26 eV, which is 0.12 eV above the band gap of pure ZrO2 (5.14 eV). It indicates that lanthana addition caused a rise of band gap, which prohibits the charge transfer from O2− to M+n in the new support. Thus, we can say that electronically the support lanthana-zirconia is stable than that of only zirconia. 5Ni/LaZr catalyst showed UV band at about 280 nm for the transition from O2− to octahedral Ni+2 (O2− → Ni2+) in NiO lattice (Fig. 4(A)) [59,60]. The bands about 377 and 410 nm were associated with the d-d transition from 3A2g(F) state to 3T1g(P) state of Ni+2 in an octahedral environment, whereas band about 718 nm shows the d-d transition from 3A2g(F) state to 3T1g(F) state of the Ni+2 octahedral environment [58,61–63]. This transition is more electronically favourable because the band gap of the 5Ni/LaZr catalyst system is found to reduce to 3.46 eV with respect to lanthana-zirconia system (band gap 5.14 eV) (Fig. 4(B)). After the addition of 1% ceria promoter, the band at 280 nm was intensified. It indicates that charge transfer band from O2− to Ce+3/Ce+4 merged with charge transfer band of O2− → Ni2+ [64] As the ceria proportion was increasing, the band at 280 nm was intensified (Fig. 4(C)). The band of d-d transition about 410 nm for 3A2g(F) state to 3T1g(P) state of Ni+2 (octahedral) was found to be demolished as well as ceria loading was increasing; however, the d-d transition band from 3A2g(F) state to 3T1g(F) state of Ni+2 (octahedra) did not be affected by ceria loading as a promoter. In all ceria loading, the band gaps of catalyst systems remained below 3.40 eV. To study the conditions and sites of CH4 decomposition, CH4-temperature programmed surface reaction (CH4-TPSR) experiment over LaZr, 5Ni/LaZr and 5Ni2.5Ce/LaZr were carried out as shown in Fig. 5 . For mesoporous lanthana-zirconia support (LaZr), a single prominent consumption peak at about 870 °C was observed due to thermal decomposition of CH4 and promotional role of the ZrO2 redox for oxidizing carbon species (which was formed after CH4 thermal decomposition) [65]. At 5Ni/LaZr catalyst, a low intense low-temperature CH4 consumption peak (∼400 °C) and an intermediate temperature broad, large peak (450–800 °C) were also found. The lower temperature peak was due to CH4 decomposition at Ni, whereas intermediate temperature peak was for CH4 decomposition at the intimate contact between Ni and lanthana-zirconia (LaZr) interface. Promotional addition of ceria on lanthana-zirconia supported Ni catalyst did not show a significant change in the CH4-TSPR pattern. Overall, it indicated that the majority of CH4 decompositions seemed to happen at Ni-LaZr interface. To understand the reducing-oxidizing surface behaviour of 5Ni/LaZr and 5Ni2.5Ce/LaZr, we have carried out “H2TPR-CO2TPD-H2TPR cycle”. H2-TPR of 5Ni/LaZr catalyst sample shows a remarkable peak in the low-temperature range (250−310 °C) and a prominent intense peak at high-temperature range (450–550 ℃) (Fig. 6 (A)). The lower peak was attributed to reduction peak of “NiO weakly interacted with the support” whereas the high-temperature peak signifies the reduction peak of “NiO strongly interacted with the support”. H2-TPR of 5Ni2.5Ce/LaZr catalyst sample showed prominent growth in lower temperature peaks than the high-temperature peak. It indicates that ceria addition promotes the cultivation of easier reducible NiO species (Fig. 6 (B)). CO2-TPD is carried out in continuation with H2-TPR over 5Ni/LaZr and 5Ni2.5Ce/LaZr catalyst system. In our previous publication, the CO2-TPD of 5Ni2.5Ce/LaZr, Samsudeen et al. [66] have reported the presence of a low concentration of weak basic sites (surface hydroxyl) at 266 ℃, intense intermediate strength basic sites (surface oxygen anion) about 400 ℃ and broad but diffuse strong basic sites (bulk oxygen anion/oxygen vacancy) about 650 ℃. As per the expectation here, when CO2-TPD is carried out after H2-TPR; both intermediate and high-temperature peaks disappeared. It indicates that during the reduction under H2 stream, oxygen anion responsible for “intermediate and strong basic sites” are removed. It will be interesting to observe that may this loss be overcome by CO2. Possibly during the CO2-TPD, these sites may replenish oxygen from CO2. So, in continuation of CO2-TPD; again, H2-TPR was carried out on the same catalyst. It gives interesting and informative results. Both peaks in low-temperature ranges, as well as high temperature, are suppressed, and an intense peak in the intermediate temperature 391 °C region appeared. Alfatish et al. claimed that the peak was due to the reduction of CeO2-ZrO2 and NiOCe solid solutions [33]. The “H2TPR-CO2TPD-H2TPR cycle” shows that 5Ni/LaZr and 5Ni2.5Ce/LaZr catalyst surface are reducible in H2 stream, the reduced surface was re-oxidized in CO2 stream, and then again, the oxidized surface is reducible in H2 stream. To understand the reactive nature of carbon deposit in reducing atmosphere, Temperature Programmed Hydrogenation (TPH) was carried out by 10%H2 in Ar over spent 5Ni2.5CeLaZr, and the corresponding profile is shown in (Fig. 7 (A)). A sharp peak and shoulder were found in the temperature range of 100−300 °C, whereas a broad but less intense peak was found in the region of 375–600 °C. The peak temperature position is related to the chemical equilibrium between CHx species (x = 3, 2, 1) and their activity towards hydrogen [67,68]. Overall, these peaks are claimed due to hydrogenation of CHx species into CH4 by hydrogen. O2-Temperature Programmed Oxidation (O2-TPO) was carried out by 10%O2 in Ar over spent 5Ni2.5CeLaZr, and the corresponding profile is shown in (Fig. 7(B)). It shows two oxidizing peaks at 400 and 550 °C. Low temperature, the low-intensity peak is related to easily oxidizable amorphous α-carbon (intermediate of methane decomposition), whereas higher temperature, a high-intensity sharp peak is related to moderately oxidizable β-carbon species/less inert carbon species) [73,74]. CO2-TPD of fresh and spent 5Ni2.5CeLaZrO2 catalyst showed that basic sites density of all types are demolished after the reaction (Fig. S4). However, if O2-TPO is carried out after CO2-TPD, it shows more intense peaks than simple O2-TPO peaks. It indicates that CO2 may react with carbon deposit and forms oxygenated species [75]. Oxygenated species are more oxidizable and give higher intensity peaks during O2-TPO experiment [68]. So, if O2-TPO is carried out after TPH, most intense peaks about 400 °C and 550 °C (than simple O2-TPO peaks) are shown. In TPH, it was discussed that H2 stream hydrogenates weakly bond carbon intermediates/species (CHx) that desorbed as CH4. H2 stream may also hydrogenates strongly bond carbon intermediate/species that did not desorb during TPH but can be oxidized by oxygen during O2-TPO experiment. 4 Discussion CH4 decomposition over supported Nickel is well known [76] whereas ZrO2 system is quite basic to interact with CO2 for a possible DRM reaction [77,78]. However, XRD profiles showed that “zirconia supported Ni catalyst” system is prone for crystalline carbon deposition during reaction which encounters inferior catalytic performance. It results in inferior catalytic H2 yield (43 %), which slows down to 37 % after 460-minute time on stream. Ceria promotional addition to “zirconia supported Ni catalyst” causes rapid wash away of carbon (by oxidation of deposit) and so the catalytic activity increased to 47 % H2 yield (against 43 % at zirconia supported Ni catalyst). Constant deposit wash from the catalytic active sites also causes constant yield up to 460 min time on stream. However, defective zirconia phases and fractional phase transformation of monoclinic zirconia to cubic zirconia at high temperature reaction conditions limits catalytic performance. When support is made up of “9%lanthana-91% zirconia”, infrared results show the bonding between La2O3and ZrO2 species. The band gap of support lanthana-zirconia was increased by 0.06 eV than pure zirconia (5.08 eV). XRD profile did not show La2O3 related phase, but it showed phase for ZrO2. It indicates that lanthana addition stabilizes the zirconia phase. The CO2-TPD profile of zirconia (prepared by Silva et al. [79]) and lanthana-zirconia (prepared by Alfathesh et al. [66] are reported very similar in earlier works. After the dispersion of Ni over thermally stable lanthana-zirconia (5Ni/LaZr), defective zirconia phase was not found after the reaction. IR spectra of 5Ni/LaZr also show the presence of La2O2CO3 species. The UV band shows a reduction of band gap to 3.12 eV (concerning 5.14 eV of lanthana-zirconia), favourable d-d transition and presence of Ni+2 in an octahedral environment. CH4-TPSR shows CH4 dissociation over Ni-support (LaZr) interface. Overall, the increasing CO2 interaction with ZrO2 as well as La2O3, prominent CH4 decomposition at Ni-LaZr interface, excellent thermal stability, low band gap over “lanthana-zirconia supported Ni” catalyst pivots the path of DRM and ensures high H2 yield up to 80 %. H2 yield decreased to 75 % in 460 min in time on stream test (TOS). However, the XRD profile of the spent catalyst shows the presence of high-intensity NiO. It indicates that NiO crystallites assemble during the reaction, and at the end of the reaction, NiO is poorly dispersed. XRD profile indicates that on the promotional addition of ceria in lanthana-zirconia supported Ni catalyst (5Ni1Ce/LaZr), a ceria-zirconia mixed oxide is formed as well as NiO dispersion is maintained during the reaction. It indicates that the ceria controls the NiO dispersion during the reaction by increasing NiO-support interaction. As the loading of ceria increases, IR peak due to La2O2CO3 gets intensified, the UV band for charge transfer transition from O2− to Ce+3/Ce+4 get intensified, and the d-d transition band for 3A2g (F) to 3T1g (F) in Ni+2 (octahedral) was demolished. It indicates that the presence of ceria, prominently influence the electronic transition over the catalyst surface where the band gap remained below 3.38 eV. At particular, ceria loading 2.5 %, Alfatish et al. has shown increased CO2 adsorption at intermediate/strong strength basic sites or oxygen anion [66]. “H2TPR-CO2TPD-H2TPR cycle” showed that CO2 causes increased NiO-support interaction as well as oxygen replenishment form CO2 to the catalytic surface to increase oxygen mobility for the oxidation of C-Nin species (which was formed after CH4 decomposition at Ni surface). Overall, it can be said that CO2 interaction with entire system (ZrO2, La2O3, CeO2), CH4 decomposition over stabilized/dispersed Ni-LaZr interface, subsequent interaction of C-Nin species with mobile oxygen (replenished by CO2)/Interacted CO2 to the surface, excellent thermal stability, low band gap over 5Ni2.5Ce/LaZr catalyst governs highest H2 yield ∼87 % which remains constant throughout the 460 min in TOS. The TPH experiment shows that even ceria promoted catalyst may have some carbon deposits; however, it is reducible and removable in the early temperature range (100−300 °C) or below the reaction temperature 650 °C. As the ceria loading increases more than 2.5 %, comparable lower, but constant H2 yield ∼80 % is noticed. Ni/CeO2 system is also a well-known catalyst for reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS) [80]. So, possibly comparably lower H2 yield is due to consumption of H2 in a reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction (CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O) which is highly favoured at the high reaction temperature. “TPH followed by O2-TPO” and “CO2TPD followed by O2-TPO” shows that H2 and CO2 environment may also induce oxygenated and hydrogenated carbon deposit at catalyst surface which may deactivate the catalyst if not removed from the catalyst surface. Based on all characterization results, the reaction mechanism of H2 production through DRM can be summarized in two sections. The first is the decomposition of CH4 largely at Ni-LaZr interface into H2 and C-Nin species (Reaction 1) [16]. The second is washing away of carbon deposits over Ni metal through the oxidation by CO2. The second step should be emphasized more deeply. CO2 may interact with basic ZrO2 or La2O3-ZrO2 surfaces, and it may be potentially adsorbed on La2O3 in the form of La2O2CO3 (Reaction 2–4). At high reaction temperature, this interacted/potentially adsorbed CO2 tends to be mobile, reaches Ni-LaZr interface, attacks carbon species (C-Nin) and forms two CO molecules (Reaction 5). Ceria promotional addition generates an oxygen vacancy in the catalytic system by reduction of Ce+4 to Ce+3. It becomes new adsorption as well as decomposition sites for CO2. Very soon, oxygen vacancies are replenished by these reactive oxygen species from the CO2 decomposition (Reaction 6). These reactive oxygen species are mobile and vital oxidizing species for carbon species oxidation at Ni (Reaction 7). Delay in the interaction between C-Nin and mobile oxygen/interacted CO2 results in oligomer/polymer formation, leading to catalytic deactivation (Reaction 8). (1) CH4 + Nin → C-Nin + 2H2 (2) ZrO2 + CO2 → ZrO2----CO2 (3) La2O3+ CO2 → La2O3----CO2 (4) La2O3 + CO2 → La2O2CO3 (5) C-Nin + CO2 (adsorbed) → 2CO + Nin (6) Vo + CO2 → CO + O; where Vo is oxygen vacancy (7) C-Nin + O → CO + Nin (8) mC-Nin → C..-C..-C.. 5 Conclusion High yield of hydrogen solely depends on the decomposition of CH4 largely at Ni-LaZr interface into H2 and C-Nin species as well as wash away of carbon deposit through oxidation by CO2. Zirconia supported Ni catalyst is potent in H2 production, but graphitic carbon rendered it for inferior 43 % H2 yield. Ceria promotion also washes the carbon deposit by the mobile oxygen and amends progress in activity, but the defective support limits the H2 yield to 47 %. The addition of 9% lanthana into zirconia support causes stabilization of zirconia phase. lanthana-zirconia supported Ni catalyst has thermally stabilized support, Ni-LaZr interface for CH4 decomposition, wide basic surfaces CO2 interaction, CO2 coordinated La+3 sites (as La2O2CO3 species) and low band gap. Altogether, it governs 80 % H2 yield. Promotional addition of ceria controls the NiO dispersion during the reaction and adds mobile oxygen in the system, which is replenished back by oxygen from CO2. 5Ni2.5Ce/LaZr shows marked 87 % H2 yield, which remained constant up to 460 min. More than 2.5 % ceria loading shows comparably lower H2 yield (∼80 %) due to consumption of the H2 in a reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction (CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O).

        "dc:description": "Hydrogen production from dry reforming of methane (DRM) over chief Ni-based catalyst is cutting edge research area due to environmental consciousness about reducing global warming gases (CH4 and CO2) and greener route of synthesis. Herein, ceria promoted lanthanum-zirconia supported Ni catalyst system (5NixCe/LaZr; x = 0, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 5 wt.%) is prepared by the wet impregnation method. It is further characterized using X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet spectroscopy, temperature-programmed and cyclic temperature-programmed experiments. 2.5 wt.% ceria promoted lanthana-zirconia supported Ni catalyst (5Ni2.5Ce/LaZr) has thermally stabilized the support, wide Ni-LaZr interface for CH4 decomposition, wide basic surfaces (La2O3-ZrO2) for CO2 interaction, CO2 coordinated La+3 sites (as La2O2CO3 species), low band gap and oxygen vacancy carrying mobile oxygen (which is replenished by CO2). Altogether, it produces more than 87 % hydrogen yield. This thorough study and fine correlation will help design industrially suitable catalyst for hydrogen production through DRM.",
