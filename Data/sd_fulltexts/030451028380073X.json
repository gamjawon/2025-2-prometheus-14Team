From the reaction solution a complex was isolated, -\"P^H) NMR of which showed that coordination of PPh3 occurs not only to the axial but also to the equatorial positions of the Rh-Rh axis. When this complex is used as a catalyst with PPh3 and acetic acid present, no induction period was observed, which appears for the catalyst generated in situ. Drastic changes in catalytic properties occurred by replacing Rh;(OAc)4 with Rh2(OCOCF3)4 or PPh3 with P(OPh)3, which indicate prospects of tailor-making the catalyst. Introduction Considerable attention has been devoted to liquid-phase catalytic dehydrogenation of alcohols in connection with energy storage problems, due to its advantage of spontaneous separation of hydrogen into the gas phase [1 - 4]. Two kinds of homogeneous catalysts with high selectivity are known, rhodium(III)-tin(II) chloride complexes [5] and M(OCOCF3)2(CO)- (PPh3)i (M = Ru, Os) [6], but their activities seem yet insufficient from a practical viewpoint [4]. While the utilization of photon energy to enhance catalytic activity is promising, allowing hybridized use of solar energy (photon and heat) [I], we have attempted here to search for more active catalysts (in the dark) than those already reported. Since catalytic activity (and/or selectivity) is often improved in the polynuclear form of complexes with metal-metal bonding [7], we have adopted a dinuclear rhodium(II) complex Rh2(OAc)4, known as a catalyst for olefin hydrogenation [8], and investigated the liquid-phase dehydrogenation of 2-propanol. *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/83/0000-0000/$03.00 Eisevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 100 Experimental Rh2(OAc)4 and Rh2(OCOCF3)4 were prepared by literature methods [9, 10]. 2-Propanol was dried over CaO and distilled before use. The 2-propanol solution containing an appropriate amount of catalyst (200 ml) was deaer- ated with nitrogen before the reaction. The reactor was equipped with a thermometer and a reflux condenser, to which a gas-buret was attached. When the refluxing of the solution became stationary, volumetry of the gas phase was started. After the reaction was stopped, the amount of acetone was determined by gas chromatography (PEG 1000) to ensure the material balance of H^ (coincided within 3% error). The electronic spectra were measured with a photometric spectrometer (Beckman-25) at ambient temperature. 31? NMR spectra were obtained in a CDC13 solution, using gated decoupling techniques to eliminate NOE [11], on a Fourier transform pulsed NMR spectrometer (24.21 MHz, Jeol JNM- FX60). Field-frequency control (lock) was effected by means of a solvent deuterium resonance. Chemical shifts are given relative to the external 85% H3PU4 reference, where a negative sign indicates a shift to higher field. Any errors in the relative abundance of phosphines due to differences in T; were ruled out by comparing peak-area ratios to those in a small-pulse-width, long- pulse-delay experiment. Results and discussion Although Rh2(OAc)4 itself possesses no catalytic activity for the dehydrogenation of 2-propanol, the presence of activating ligand PPh3 [12] caused the reaction to proceed catalytically. The progress of the reaction with various [PPl^]/[Rh2(OAc)4] ratios, monitored by H^ gas evolution, is shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Apparently, as a characteristic feature of the catalyst system, induction periods exist and gradual deactivation of the catalyst gives sigmoidal time dependence on the whole. When the fastest rate during the reaction is taken as a measure of the catalytic activity, the catalyst is found most active at the ratio of [PPh3] /[Rh2(OAc)4] ^ 8 (Fig. 3). The adduct formation of Rh2(OAc)4 with various Lewis bases at its axial position is instantaneous and highly thermodynamically-favored [13]. Actually, when PPh3 was added to the 2-propanol solution of Rh2(OAc)4 at room temperature, Rh2(OAc)4(PPh3)2 precipitated immediately as an orange- red crystal [14] (elemental analysis; calc: %C = 54.7, %H = 4.4; found: %C = 55.0, %H = 4.1, electronic spectrum: A^ax = 480 nm ((^He, and CH^ solu- tions)). Upon heating the solution to start the reaction, the precipitate disap- peared completely (within ca. 1.5 h), and the homogenized solution turned purple red (deeply colored when [PPh3]/[Rh2(OAc)4] > 6). After the reac- tion rate slowed down considerably, the color of the solution turned into orange yellow. By occasional measurement of the electronic spectrum (under 101 Fig. l.

Although the complex has not yet been fully characterized, recrystallization from CH^C^/n-pentane gave purple-red needles, whose -\"P^H) NMR spectrum is shown in Fig. 4 (with a first-order analysis). The lack of second-order effects is typical for dirhodium compounds Rh-Rh bonds (\"C m Cp2Rh2(CO)3 [15], \"P in Rl^Lg (L = PF3 [16], P(OMe)3 [17]), and the spectrum indicates the presence of the fol- lowing moiety in the structure: ^3 ^Y-^X-^S ^3 OA = 5.7 ppm, OB = 25.7 ppm, JAB = 6.8 Hz, J^x = 132.6 Hz, JAY = 28.5 Hz, JBX = 151.8 Hz, JBY = 2.9 Hz, L/xYl<7Hz (by spectrum simulation). 30 20 10 S l ppm Fig. 4. ^P^H) NMR spectrum of a catalytically active dirhodium complex isolated from the reaction solution (CDC13 solution, 24.21 MHz, room temperature, 85% H3P04 stan- dard), and the first order analysis based on a AB^XY spin system. Since PPh3 exists in the solution in a fairly excess amount to Rh2(OAc)4, the coordination of PPh3 at the equatorial positions may be a possible pro- cess. In a heated 2-propanol solution (under N3), the complex decomposed rapidly to give a brown solution, with virtually no accompanying H; evolu- tion. When PPh3 and acetic acid were added to the solution, decomposition was prevented and the complex exhibited a catalytic activity for more than 103 10 h without any induction period. This fact suggests that it is a close precursor to catalytically active species. The effect of the extra addition of acetic acid on the time course of the reaction is shown in Fig. 5. While elongation of the induction period is observed with increased amounts of added acetic acid, a maximum rate is attained for [AcOH]/[Rh2(OAc)4] =20 (32.8 tumovers/h, based on the total amount of dirhodium added). 1000 - K 800 - 600 400 - 200 - 40 60 80 Time / h Fig. 5.

Figure 6 presents changes of the time course of the reaction caused by the replacement of the catalyst: (1) Rh2(OCOCF3)4 for Rh2(OAc)4 and (2) P(OPh)3 for PPh3. The disappearance of the induction period in the case of Rh2(OCOCF3)4 is due to the character of CF3COO~ as a weakly-coordinating ligand in comparison to Ac0~. The shorter catalyst life with P(OPh3) may reflect instability of the associated complexes. Such a conspicuous depen- dence on the nature of RCOCT or PR'3 suggests that the catalyst can be tailored for improving and controlling its activity. References 1 S. Shinoda, H. Moriyama, Y.
