The results showed that the magnetic separation was influenced by gravity and inertia forces. Large particles had a tendency to accumulate in the accepted, least magnetic fraction which is to be returned to the regenerator. The results also indicated that the two equilibrium catalysts under investigation could respond somewhat differently to the magnetic separation. The equilibrium catalysts and the treated catalysts with the most magnetic fraction removed, were tested and evaluated in a modified ARCO pilot unit. The feed used was a North Sea 375+atmospheric residue. The evaluation showed that the catalytic activity increased, resulting in higher gasoline production at the expense of gas and coke, when the most magnetic fraction was removed. The economic evaluation showed a potential for improved cost margins for both catalysts if the benefit of the magnetic separation was used to improve catalyst activity, selectivity and throughput in the FCC unit at constant catalyst make up rate. If on the other hand the benefit of the magnetic separation was used to lower the catalyst consumption the addition of value would rise to a lesser degree.

Introduction Catalytic cracking of atmospheric residues is today a common technique for upgrading of heavy oils to transportation fuels. One drawback when processing heavy oils is, however, that metals present in the feed, such as nickel and vanadium, deposit and accumulate on the catalyst. Metal contamination of the catalyst will * Corresponding author. 0926-860X/97/$17.00 ,~, 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. PII S0926-860X(97)00033-1 292 S.-I. Andersson, T. Myrstad/Applied Catalysis A: General 159 (1997) 291-304 thus increase with time. This poisoning of the catalyst will result in a reduction in activity and a selectivity shift. In order to prevent this, and also to keep the activity and the metal content at a constant and acceptable level, equilibrium catalyst is continuously withdrawn from the FCC unit and replaced by new fresh catalyst. Over time, the catalyst inventory will consist of particles of varying ages [ 1 ]. Some particles will have been in the FCC unit only for a short period of time whilst other particles will have been there for months. The equilibrium catalyst withdrawn is therefore a mixture of active catalyst particles and old deactivated catalyst particles. In order to use the catalyst inventory more effectively and not discard still usable catalyst, the equilibrium catalyst can be separated by the MagnaCatTM process [2,3] into two fractions, one least magnetic still usable part and one most magnetic unusable part. Two different equilibrium catalysts have been treated in the MagnaCa(TM process in the current work. The catalysts have subsequently been tested and evaluated in a modified ARCO pilot unit [4], using atmospheric residue as feed. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalysts Two different equilibrium catalysts, denoted A and B, were withdrawn from a FCC unit. Catalysts A and B were produced by two different vendors, both were recommended for residue operation. Each equilibrium catalyst was then separated by the MagnaCatTM process into four fractions with different magnetic suscept- ibility. The separation was undertaken by Refining Process Services (RPS) in the Ashland MagnaCatTM pilot unit [3]. According to RPS, the separation was not optimized. Optimization of the magnetic separation would probably have resulted in improvement in the separations. In a commercial MagnaCatTM unit the catalyst can be separated into two or three fractions. To simulate the less magnetic fraction that is put back into the regenerator, for catalyst A, a quantity of the three least magnetic fractions were mixed together to a McatA (90%) catalyst. For catalyst B a quantity of the three least magnetic fractions were mixed together to a McatB (90%) catalyst and another quantity of the two least magnetic fractions were mixed together to a McatB (80%) catalyst. All in correct proportions compared to the equilibrium catalyst. 2.2. Characterizing of the catalysts The BET area and pore size distribution of the equilibrium catalysts and the different MagnaCatTM separated fractions were determined in a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 instrument by nitrogen. The matrix area was determined using the S.-L Andersson, T.

The pai'iicle size distribution of the equilibrium catalysts and the MagnaCatTM separated fractions was determined using a Malvern Mastersizer instrument. The elemental analysis and the magnetic measurements of the equilibrium catalysts and the MagnaCatTM separated fractions was performed by RPS. 2.3. Pilot unit test of the catalysts The pilot plant tests were performed in the modified ARCO pilot plant unit at Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden [4]. The feed used was a North Sea 375+atmospheric residue, see Table 1. The reactor was operated at 500 and the regenerator at 700. All tests were performed under steady state conditions in the pilot unit. The reaction products were collected. The feed and the liquid products were weighed. The flue gases and the product gases were measured by Elster gas volume meters and fractions of each of the gases were continuously collected for analysis with a refinery gas analyzer (Hewlett Packard 5880). The refinery gas analyzer was calibrated on a daily basis with calibration gas mixtures, composed of gases of the same concentration as those components in the flue and product gases. The liquid products were characterized by simulated distillation (Hewlett Packard 5880). The boiling point intervals for gasoline (C5 up to 216), LCO (216 up to 344) and for DCO (344 and higher) were calibrated by determining the retention times for the n-alkanes pentane, dodecane and eicosane on a daily basis. Mass balance, conversion and yields were calculated based on these analyses. Tests with a mass balance between 95 and 99 wt% were accepted, other tests were rejected. At least four tests at different conversions were used to establish the yield to conversion functions. These functions were calculated by linear regression. Differences in the gasoline yields larger than 0.25 wt% at the maximum are considered to be significant based on the above calculations. The catalyst circulation rates were calibrated prior to each test series. During the tests the catalyst circulation rates were followed indirectly. The activity curves, see 294 S.-1. Andersson T.

The resolution of these curves is considered to be better than 0.5 units of conversion. The composition of the gasoline fraction was further examined by GC/MS analyses (Fisons Instruments MD800) and the software package SI-PIONA [6]. 3. Results and discussion The two different equilibrium catalysts were separated by RPS in the Ashland MagnaCatTM pilot unit. Each equilibrium catalyst was separated into four fractions with different magnetic susceptibility, see Table 2. It can be seen from Table 2 that the most magnetic fraction had a much higher magnetic susceptibility and the second most magnetic fraction had a slightly higher magnetic susceptibility than the equilibrium catalyst. It may also be seen that it was only the least magnetic fraction that had a metal content lower than the equilibrium catalyst. The equilibrium catalysts and the different MagnaCatTM separated fractions were also characterized according to their BET, matrix and zeolite areas, see Table 3. It can be seen from Table 3, that for catalyst B, the BET area and the zeolite area were highest for the least magnetic fractions and then decreased the more magnetic the fraction became. This was expected, as the fresher catalyst particles are present in the least magnetic fraction and the older ones in the most magnetic fraction. The matrix area was almost constant for the different fractions.

Andersson, T. Myrstad/Applied Catalysis A: General 159 (1997) 291-304 For catalyst A the picture was somewhat confusing. The BET area as well as the matrix area had a minimum for the second least magnetic fraction, and the zeolite area had a minimum for the second most magnetic fraction. The same result was expected for this catalyst as for catalyst B. The difference might be explained by the fact that two different catalyst additives had been added to the FCC unit together with this catalyst. The different MagnaCatTM separated fractions and the equilibrium catalysts were also characterized according to their particle size distribution. As can be seen in Table 4 the equilibrium catalysts had an average particle size of 80 ~m. The average particle size for the MagnaCatTM separated fractions had a minimum for the second most magnetic fraction. This was unexpected but can be explained by the way the MagnaCatTM separation is performed [3]. The equilibrium catalyst consists of particles of different ages and different magnetic susceptibility. For every susceptibility there are particles of various diameters. In the MagnaCatTM separation, the equilibrium catalyst is fed to a belt [7]. The permanent magnets are placed at the roller, where the belt turns direction. The most magnetic particles are retained on the belt by the magnetic force whilst the other particles fall off. The particles are influenced not only by the magnetic force but also of the gravity and inertia forces. The most magnetic fraction had a higher average particle size than the second most magnetic fraction as the large particles, with high magnetic susceptibility fell into the rejected fraction. The shift in the particle size distribu- tion might result in poorer fiuidization properties for the catalyst. Whether any fluidization problems will occur in the FCC unit or not will depend on the unit design, however in most modern FCC units the observed change in the particle size distribution is not expected to cause any fluidization problems. Optimization of the magnetic separation would probably have resulted in further improvement in the separations. In the pilot unit the equilibrium catalysts A and B were tested together with the MagnaCatTM separated fractions McatA (90%), McatB (90%) and McatB (80%). These catalysts were tested with the North Sea 375+atmospheric residue feed. It can be seen from Fig. 1 that the catalyst McatA (90%) was more active than the equilibrium catalyst EcatA. At a catalyst to oil ratio (C/O) of 8 the conversion was 1.4% higher for McatA (90%) than for EcatA. In the same figure it can also be seen that for catalyst B the MagnaCatTM separated catalysts McatB (90%) and McatB (80%) were more active than the equilibrium catalyst EcatB. For this catalyst the conversion was 2.8 wt% higher for McatB (90%) and 3.2 wt% higher for McatB (80%) than for EcatB. The difference between the two catalysts A and B indicates that different catalysts respond differently to the MagnaCatTM separation. The figure also indicates that the activity of the most magnetic fraction was very low for catalyst B. For catalyst A, however, the figure indicates that the most magnetic fraction was more active than the corresponding fraction for catalyst B. This may be explained by the difference in the matrix area between the two catalyst fractions. The larger matrix area for the most magnetic fraction for catalyst A can S.-I. Andersson, T. Myrstad/Applied Catalysis A: General 159 (1997) 291-304 297 withstand metal poisoning to a different degree than the smaller matrix area in the corresponding fraction for catalyst B. The amount of total gas (Ca-) decreases for both catalysts A and B when the most magnetic fraction is removed. The reason for this, however, is to be found in the LPG (C3--~-C4) fraction for catalyst A, see Fig. 4, and in the dry gas (Cl+C2) fraction for catalyst B, see Figs, 2 and 3. ~ 35 -- o \"e . - :-%' . o 2505\" 70 75 aO e5 conversion (wt%) Fig. 2.

LPG yield as a function of conversion: ([~) - EcatA; (,) - McatA (90%); (/k) - EcatB; (C)) - McatB (90%); (@) - McatB (80%). For catalyst A there is a slight decrease in the yield of hydrogen for McatA (90%) compared to EcatA because of the decrease of metals content. There is no decrease in the yields of C~+C2. For catalyst B, however, the decrease of metals decreased the yield of hydrogen considerably for McatB (90%) compared to EcatB. There was also an accompanying decrease in the C1+C2 yields (see Figs. 2 and 3). This might be explained by the small matrix area of the B catalyst, as the metals are more concentrated. Changes will therefore be more pronounced for catalyst B than for catalyst A. The yield of LPG was lower for the McatA (90%) catalyst than for EcatA. One explanation for this may be the higher gasoline selectivity of the MagnaCatTM separated catalyst compared to the equilibrium catalyst. For catalyst B, however, there was very little difference between the MagnaCatTM separated catalysts and the equilibrium catalyst. See Fig. 4. When the most magnetic fraction was removed the gasoline yield increased as can be seen in Fig. 5. For catalyst A the gasoline yield of McatA (90%) was 0.5 wt% higher than that for EcatA at a conversion of 75 wt%. For catalyst B the yield of gasoline increased with 1,1 wt% for McatB (90%) and with 1.6 wt% for McatB (80%) also at a conversion of 75 wt%. Removing the most magnetic fraction gave a better gasoline selectivity. The most magnetic fraction contained more metals and had the lowest activity of the fractions present. This fraction also gave more hydrogen and more coke than the other fractions and had a lower bottoms cracking activity. It was obvious that the most magnetic fraction of catalyst B had a lower activity than the most magnetic fraction of catalyst A. Due to the more selective cracking of the feed to gasoline for the MagnaCatTM separated catalysts compared to the equilibrium catalyst the LCO yields were S.-I. Andersson, T.

For catalyst A the yield of DCO was almost equal for the MagnaCat separated catalyst compared to the equilibrium catalyst. For catalyst B, however, the yield of DCO was higher for the MagnaCatTM separated catalyst compared to the equili- brium catalyst, see Fig. 7. This was somewhat surprising but may, however, be explained by the fact that the condensation reactions forming coke-like materials 300 S.-I. Andersson, T.

The coke yield for catalyst A was the same for both the MagnaCat separated catalyst and the equilibrium catalyst. For catalyst B, the equilibrium catalyst had a higher coke yield than the MagnaCatTM separated catalysts, see Fig. 8. One reason for this may be the removal of the most magnetic fraction, which was a great contributor to the coke and gas yield for catalyst B. Another reason may be the S.-L Andersson, T. Myrstad/Applied Catalysis A: General 159 (1997) 291-304 301 lower proportion of condensation products present for the MagnaCatTM separated fractions. A very important quality factor of the gasoline is the octane numbers RON and MON. Both for catalyst A and for catalyst B the octane numbers decreased at constant conversion in this investigation, when the most magnetic fraction was removed, see Figs. 9 and 10.

In FCC gasoline, both olefins and aromatics are important contributors to the octane numbers. The formation of aromatics and paraffins from olefins and naphtenes is influenced by the hydrogen transfer reaction in Y zeolites [9]. Olefins + Naphtenes --~ Paraffins + Aromatics Both nickel and vanadium inhibits hydrogen transfer reactions, whilst promot- ing dehydrogenation reactions, giving gas and coke [10]. Dehydrogenation reac- tions such as Paraffins --~ Olefins Naphtenes --~ Aromatics are also promoted. This may be an explanation as to why catalyst B showed a higher change in gasoline aromatics than catalyst A. Cheng et al. have also observed, in an earlier investigation, that the octane numbers of the FCC gasoline increased with increasing nickel and vanadium contents of the catalysts [11]. In a commercial FCC unit lower metal levels would permit a higher conversion or a higher reactor temperature and this would neutralize the negative effect on octane numbers [ 12]. An economic evaluation of the MagnaCatTM process based on the present pilot plant data has also been undertaken. The benefit of the magnetic separation may be exploited in many ways. One possible exploitation may be to keep catalyst circulation, feed rate and catalyst addition constant. This will increase conversion and give a better yield structure with higher octane numbers. Another use may be to keep catalyst circulation and addition constant and increase the throughput in the FCC unit to maintain constant conversion. Even in this case there will be a better yield structure, however, the octane numbers will decrease. A third use may be to decrease catalyst addition and maintain throughput, conversion and catalyst circulation constant. In this case there will be a reduced catalyst consumption and a better yield structure but the octane numbers will decrease. The economical evaluation was performed by using A-pilot plant yields between the equilibrium S.-L Andersson, T. Myrstad/Applied Catalysis A: General 159 (1997) 291-304 303 catalysts and the MagnaCatTM separated catalysts obtained in this work. By using typical product prices, the economical evaluation showed that in a 45 MBPD FCC unit processing a feed as described in Table 1, the addition of value would rise with $4 MM to $6 MM per year for the two first cases. For the last case, however, the estimated addition of value would rise to a lesser degree. This indicates that the full economic benefit of the process will only be obtained if the catalyst addition is kept constant. This is in good agreement with earlier published data [2]. 4. Conclusions The MagnaCa(TM process was tested with two equilibrium catalysts. For both these catalysts the activity and the selectivity increased when the most magnetic fraction was removed and the metal contents (Ni, V) decreased. Compared to the equilibrium catalysts the gasoline yield increased due to a more selective cracking of the feed to gasoline for the MagnaCatTM separated catalysts. The yield of hydrogen decreased for the MagnaCatTM separated catalysts compared to the equilibrium catalysts due to the lower metal contents. Measurements of the particle size distribution for the different fractions sepa- rated by the MagnaCatTM process showed that there were an accumulation of large particles in the accepted least magnetic fraction. This could be explained by the fact that the particles were influenced not only by the magnetic force but also of gravity and inertia forces. The results from the pore size and particle size distribution measurements also indicated that different equilibrium catalysts could respond somewhat different to the magnetic separation. An economic evaluation of the magnetic separation of equilibrium catalysts by the MagnaCatTM process based on the present pilot plant test data has been performed. This evaluation showed that the addition of value would rise with $4 MM to $6 MM per year due to higher catalyst activity and selectivity and higher gasoline yield at constant catalyst addition. If the benefit of the MagnaCatTM process was used to lower the catalyst addition the estimated addition of value would rise less, but may still be attractive in certain cases.

Two different equilibrium catalysts from a FCC unit have been separated by the MagnaCat™ process, into fractions of different magnetic susceptibility. The results showed that the magnetic separation was influenced by gravity and inertia forces. Large particles had a tendency to accumulate in the accepted, least magnetic fraction which is to be returned to the regenerator. The results also indicated that the two equilibrium catalysts under investigation could respond somewhat differently to the magnetic separation. The equilibrium catalysts and the treated catalysts with the most magnetic fraction removed, were tested and evaluated in a modified ARCO pilot unit. The feed used was a North Sea 375°C+atmospheric residue. The evaluation showed that the catalytic activity increased, resulting in higher gasoline production at the expense of gas and coke, when the most magnetic fraction was removed. The economic evaluation showed a potential for improved cost margins for both catalysts if the benefit of the magnetic separation was used to improve catalyst activity, selectivity and throughput in the FCC unit at constant catalyst make up rate. If on the other hand the benefit of the magnetic separation was used to lower the catalyst consumption the addition of value would rise to a lesser degree.
