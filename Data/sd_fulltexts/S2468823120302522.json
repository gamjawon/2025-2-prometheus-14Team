Graphical abstract Strong electrostatic adsorption Pd-M/SiO2 catalysts show larger highly exposed and uniformly dispersed electron-deficient Pdδ+ sites that easily for electron-rich aromatics to absorb than the catalysts prepared by dry impregnation, exhibiting excellent catalytic hydrogenation performances of toluene and benzene hydrogenation. Herein, we reported an effective method to synthesis a series of supported bimetallic Pd-M/SiO2 (M = Pt, Ni, Cu, Co) catalysts with highly exposed and well-alloyed nanoparticles via simultaneous strong electrostatic adsorption (co-SEA), which controlled metal precursors strongly anchored onto the oppositely charged support (SiO2) by changing the pH relative to the surface point of zero charge (PZC). The toluene and benzene hydrogenation were used as probe reactions to evaluate the catalytic hydrogenation activity performance of the Pd-M/SiO2 catalysts. Compared to the catalysts synthesized by the common technique simultaneous dry impregnation (co-DI), the co-SEA Pd-Ni/SiO2 catalyst exhibited the highest turnover frequencies (TOFs) of 3.7 s−1 for benzene hydrogenation and 3.2 s−1 for toluene hydrogenation. This was attributed to the large amount of electron-deficient Pdδ+ sites on the surface of SEA Pd-M/SiO2 that easily for electron-rich benzene and toluene to adsorb. Besides, the co-SEA catalysts produced well stability and reusability without significant decrease in the catalytic activity after six runs. Keywords Toluene Benzene Alloy Electron-deficient sites Strong electrostatic adsorption 1 Introduction Catalytic hydrogenation of aromatic compounds has attracted great attention owing to the far-ranging of industrial processes and produced high value in practical applications. For example, as important basic functional materials and organic synthesis intermediates, cyclohexane and its derivatives were widely used in related fields such as household chemicals, pesticides, herbicides, medicines and fuels [1–3]. On the other hand, with the increasing demand for diesel fuels, it is necessary and practically significant to eliminate toxic aromatic compounds which contains a major source of air pollution [4–8]. In fact, catalytic hydrogenation has been proved a feasible way to convert aromatics to alkanes [9]. In this situation, it is imperative to develop a highly efficient hydrogenation catalyst. Supported catalysts have been widely employed in catalytic hydrogenation due to their particularly metal-support interaction and highly metallic utilization. Firstly, the specific oxide supports such as silica with a large surface area and pore structure provided a suitable site for the metal anchoring, and the hydroxyl chemistry of oxide supports played a key role in the control of the precursor–support interaction simultaneously [10]. Secondly, in the purpose of achieving the desired catalytic properties, a series of efficient non-noble metal-based catalysts (Ni-based [11]), noble metal-based catalysts (Pd-based [12], Pt-based [13], Ru-based [14], Rh-based [15]) and bimetallic catalysts (Pd-Pt [16], Ru-Ni [17], Cu-Co [18]) have been widely used in heterogeneous hydrogenation reactions. For example, in a study by Tu [19], they synthesized bi-functional Ni/IM-5 catalyst by hydrothermal and displayed excellent hydrodeoxygenation performance for bio-derived anisole to cyclohexane. Rodiansono [20] synthesized bimetallic nickel-indium alloy catalysts supported on amorphous alumina Ni-In(x)/AA catalysts via hydrothermal treatment and exhibited remarkable catalytic performance for the selective hydrogenation of furfural into furfuryl alcohol. However, the common method via simultaneous dry impregnation (co-DI) [21] usually results in large, unevenly dispersed metallic nanoparticles (NPs). The catalysts prepared by co-DI has limited in catalytic hydrogenation reactions due to intrinsic drawbacks such as low atomic utilization, weak metal-support interaction and metal aggregation [22]. Therefore, in order to increase the utilization efficiency of the supported metal atoms, the factors such as metallic NPs size [23], metal-support interaction [24–26], and active sites distribution [27] should be taken into consideration. We introduced the method based on strong electrostatic adsorption (SEA), whereby controlled metal precursors were strongly adsorbed onto oppositely charged oxide or carbon surfaces (such as SiO2) by controlling the pH relative to the surface point of zero charge (PZC, representing the pH value at which the electrical charge density on supports surface equal to zero) [28–31]. The group of JR. Regalbuto [32–34] have detailed studied the correlation between strong electrostatic interaction during impregnation and the high dispersion of reduced metals, and the corresponding metal uptakes were determined as a function of pH at fixed metal concentrations. They proposed that the SEA method can be applied for many ammine complexes to synthesize well-dispersed single metals or alloys over the support such as silica, alumina and carbon. Besides, it was also reported ionic liquid induced electrostatic stabilization could enhance the stability of Pt and Pd species [35]. The supported monometallic and bimetallic catalysts [36,37] synthesized by SEA and co-SEA (simultaneous electrostatic adsorption of two metal precursors for the synthesis of bimetallic catalysts) have produced highly dispersed, well-alloyed and tight size distributed NPs. The larger strong metal-support interaction between the metallic Pd and the support silica for SEA catalysts promote Pd species donate electron to support silica and change the frontier molecular orbital of Pd 3d, then produce strongly unusual molecular orbital interactions that back-donation from aromatics HOMO to Pd 3d orbital and increase the intrinsic catalytic activities of SEA catalysts [38]. In this work, we synthesized a series of Pd-M/SiO2 (M = Pt, Ni, Cu, Co) catalysts with highly exposed metallic sites on the surface of silica via SEA method. The co-SEA Pd-Ni/SiO2 catalyst showed the highest turnover frequencies (TOFs) of 3.7 and 3.2 s−1 for benzene and toluene hydrogenation, respectively. The intrinsic activity of SEA Pd-M/SiO2 catalysts are about twice that of the DI Pd-M/SiO2 catalysts. This is due to the adsorption and activation of benzene and toluene with negative charges were favored on the surface of SEA Pdδ+ sites, which is resulting from the electronic modification effect of SMSI (strong metal-support interactions) between the metallic Pd and the support silica for the SEA Pd-M/SiO2 catalysts. The high intrinsic catalytic activities of SEA catalysts provided brighter prospects for the catalytic hydrogenation of unsaturated aromatics. 2 Experimental 2.1 Chemical reagents The commercial fumed silica (Aladdin, China) with a surface area of 314 m2 g−1 was used as the support. The cationic precursor salts used for SEA and DI were tetraamminepalladium (II) chloride monohydrate (Pd ≥ 41 % Adamas-beta), tetraammineplatinum (II) hydroxide solution (Pt 10 % w/w Alfa Aesar), hexaamminenickel (II) chloride (98 % STREM), copper (II) nitrate hydrate (99 % Alfa Aesar) and hexaamminecobalt (III) chloride (99 % Sigma Aldrich). In order to obtain the copper tetraammine, Copper (II) nitrate was dissolved in 5 M NH4OH followed by diluted in deionized water firstly. Before used in SEA or DI, the precursor salts Pt, Pd, Ni and Co were dissolved in deionized water to achieve solutions with concentrations for 2 g L−1. The Copper precursor solution was dissolved in 200 mL of 5 M NH4OH then add deionized water to keep the same concentration. The pH values of solutions were controlled by NH4OH and HNO3. The hydrogenation substrate was benzene (99 % Aladdin) and toluene (99 % Aladdin). 2.2 Preparation of catalysts 2.2.1 Strong electrostatic adsorption (SEA) Before the synthesis of catalyst, the point of the zero charge (PZC) of the support silica must be determined. The silica supports were added into the deionized water with various initial pH values in the range of 1.0–12.0 with HNO3 and NH4OH in a 50 mL beaker and shaken for 0.5 h. Then the zeta potential values of colloid in different pH value were measured respectively after stabilization [39]. As shown in the Fig. 1 , the pH value which zeta potential equal to zero (4.3) means the PZC of the silica. Metal-uptakes were carried out in 500 mL beaker that added 305 mL metal ammine solutions at room temperature. The available surface area (SA) of silica in solution (surface loading) was kept to be equal to 1000 m2 L−1. A surface loading of 1000 m2 L−1 was calculated by adding amount of silica with the SA = 314 m2 g−1. m g = 1000 m 2 L × 300 L 1000 314 m 2 g = 0.955 g In view of the PZC of the SiO2 at 4.3, the metal precursor solutions were absorbed at pH values above it, which were adjusted by HNO3 or NH4OH. According to the metal uptake-surveys studies by Regalbuto [34], the metal surface density Γ was calculated as Γ μ mol m 2 = C metal,initial pH - C metal,final pH mg L × 10 6 μ mol mol (Surface Loading) m 2 L × Mw of Metal g mol ×1000 mg g The Cmetal, initial pH was the initial metallic density of solution after adding support silica, which 5 mL solution was taken out and calculated by ICP analysis. After stirred for 1 h to assure adsorption equilibrium, 5 mL solution was filtered and the Cmetal, final pH was given by ICP analysis. For Pd(NH3)4 2+ solution, the optimal adsorption final pH value was 11.5 (initial pH = 11.7). For bimetallic adsorptions (Pd-Ni, Pd-Cu, Pd-Pt), the concentrations of metal ammine solutions were controlled to given the expected quality ratios, and the optimal final pH was around 11.7 (initial pH = 11.9). Because of the high affinity of Co ammines for silica that lead to the formation of a new phyllosilicate phase, the Co adsorption was not related to the pH value. Thus, the Pd-Co adsorption was same as the single metal Pd (final pH = 11.5) [27]. The samples were collected by centrifugation to remove excess deionized water and then moved to vacuum oven at 60 °C drying overnight after completely metal adsorptions. Then the solid powders were put in muffle furnace at 120 °C drying for 4 h to remove moisture. The reduction was carried out with the ramp rate of 5 °C min−1 to 400 °C for 2 h in a tube furnace for oven dried catalysts. All metal oxides were ensure totally reduced with 10 vol% H2/N2 used as reducing gas. 2.2.2 Dry impregnation (DI) In order to regulate hydrogenation performance, the support silica, metal precursors and weight loadings were same as SEA for the DI catalysts. The pore volume of the silica was tested to be 2.4 mL g−1. The metal precursors were dissolved in deionized water before impregnated into the silica. Thus, the single metallic Pd precursor and bimetallic Pd-Ni, Pd-Cu, Pd-Co and Pd-Pt precursors were dissolved in 2.4 mL deionized water for 1.0 g catalyst. The silica was put in a crucible and placed on an oscillator, and metallic precursor solutions were added and shaken continuously to keep completely adsorption. Then the experimental procedure was same as SEA that samples were drying, roasting and reduction respectively. 2.3 Characterization The bulk compositions of catalysts prepared by DI and SEA were measured by the inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP–AES) to determine the metallic loadings and atomic ratios. The multipoint Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area (SBET) and pore structure (size and volume) were measured by N2 adsorption-desorption at −200 °C on a Physisorption analyzer (Micromeritics ASAP 2420). The catalysts were placed in a glass adsorption tube and degassed at 150 °C under flowing N2 for 3 h to remove the moisture before physisorption. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of catalysts were acquired on a Bruker D8 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1541 nm). The current was 45 mA and the tube voltage was 40 kV. The 2θ angles were region from 20° to 70° with a scanning rate of 0.03° s−1. The chemisorption experiments of catalysts were carried out on the Quanrachrome Autosorb-IQ gas adsorption analyzer attached to a Pfeiffer Vacuum QME220 mass spectrometer. For H2-TPR (temperature programmed reduction of hydrogen) of metal oxides, ∼50 mg weighed sample was flowed under Ar with a temperature ramp from 30 °C to 200 °C at 10 °C min−1 for 40 min and cooled to 40 °C. The sample was then purged with 10 vol% H2/Ar mixed gas instead Ar for 15 min until the signal baseline maintaining stable as monitored by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The reduction curve of H2 was then acquired at a temperature ramp from 40 °C to 750 °C at 10 °C min−1 with a heating flow rate of 40 mL min−1. The dispersion of metallic Pd was determined by CO pulse chemisorption. The weighed sample (∼100 mg) was flowed with He at 140 °C for 40 min and then cooled to 50 °C. Pure CO pulses were injected until the eluted peak did not change in intensity. The dispersion of Pd was calculated on the basis of the CO uptake with the assumptions of Pd: CO stoichiometry of 1:1. For co-SEA and co-DI catalysts, the dispersion calculations were related to Pd only based on the additive base metals Ni, Co and Cu which were inactive with CO titration at 50 °C. The stoichiometry of noble metal Pt: CO was same as Pd: CO of 1:1, then the calculation of Pd dispersion for bimetal Pd-Pt was half of the calculation result. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) spectrum was collected on a PHI Quantera SXM spectrometer with Al Kα = 1486.6 eV as the excitation source. The C 1s peak (284.8 eV) was referenced as the internal standard to reduce the sample charge effect for all binding energy (BE) values. The surface morphology and particle size were observed by high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images acquired on a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 electron microscope. The samples were prepared by dripping onto a carbon-film-coated copper grid after dispersed in anhydrous ethanol and sonicated for 10 min. The particle size and size distribution histogram in the images were counted at least 100 NPs randomly for each sample and calculated by surface-area-weighted, d T E M = ∑ n i d i 3 / ∑ n i d i 2 . The in-situ chemisorption evaluation of benzene and toluene on the catalysts were determined by temperature programmed desorption (TPD) based on mass spectrometer (MS) signal. The weighed samples used during the measurement were about 15 mg. The catalysts were immersed in benzene or toluene and shaken for 0.5 h to ensure saturated adsorption, then removed to tube furnace drying at room temperature overnight under He to get rid of the physisorbed molecules. The TCD signals and MS spectra were recorded at a temperature ramp from 40 °C to 750 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under He by tracking the parent ions at the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 92 for toluene and 78 for benzene. The in-situ Fourier-transformed infrared (FT-IR) absorption spectra for the catalysts with CO adsorbed were carried out to provide the geometric construction of metallic NPs. The catalysts were reduced under 10 vol% H2/N2 at 400 °C for 60 min and then cooled to 25 °C under evacuation. The catalysts were exposed to N2 for 10 min and changed to 1 % CO flowed for 30 min. Finally, the desorption of adsorbed CO was carried out under evacuation. Then the FT-IR spectra were recorded consecutively at varied times during the evacuation. 2.4 Catalyst testing Hydrogenation reactions of toluene and benzene were evaluated in a mechanically stirred autoclave with capacity of 100 mL (Parr Instrument Company, 8848). In a typical experiment, after charging 0.15 g of catalyst and 25 mL of toluene (benzene), the autoclave was sealed completely and then purged with H2 to expel air for three times at room temperature. The autoclave was heated to 150 °C with the stirring rate was 700 rpm, and then hydrogen was purged to 7.0 MPa to initiate the hydrogenation reaction. In the reaction course, a small aliquot of the reaction mixture was discharged per hours and the organic phase was analyzed by an Agilent GC-7820A gas chromatograph equipped with a SE-30 chromatographic column (30 m, 0.25 mm i.d., stationary phase thickness of 0.25 μm) and a thermal conductivity detector (FID) after centrifugation. The oven temperature was set to 60 °C with a temperature ramp to 180 °C at 10 °C min−1 and maintained for 10 min. Injector and FID temperatures were 250 °C and 255 °C respectively. The results for possible products were analyzed with a mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer Omnistar GSD 320). The analysis method of benzene and toluene hydrogenation is area normalization method based on the single hydrogenation product. In a typical recycling test, the mixture after one reaction cycle (1 h) was centrifuged at 8000 rpm to deposit the solid catalyst, which was washed with toluene (benzene) for 3 times and dried overnight at 60 °C for 12 h for next use directly. For comparing the intrinsic catalytic performance intuitively, the calculation of the turnover frequency (TOF) of toluene (benzene) was acquired to denote the activity. To calculate the TOF, the weight-specific activity (r 0), which was the amount of toluene (benzene) converted per gram per minute of the catalyst at zero reaction time (t 0) that acquired first by procedures proposed by Hu et al. [40]. Specifically, the experimental toluene (benzene) content-reaction time curve was fitted by a polynomial equation with respect to t, which was then differentiated, and the r0 was acquired by replacing t with zero. The TOF was acquired by TOF = M Pd × r 0/ (W × dispersion), where M Pd and W were the molar mass of Pd and metallic loading of Pd on the catalyst, and the Pd dispersion was determined by CO pulse chemisorption. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Composition, texture, and microstructure of the Pd-M/SiO2 catalysts The composition and texture properties of the SiO2 support and Pd-M/SiO2 catalysts are listed in Table 1 . The ICP-AES results show that the Pd loadings keep essentially at about 1.0 wt% for Pd-M/SiO2 catalysts prepared via SEA method, which are corresponded to a suitable surface density Γ of 0.18 μmol m−2. Based on the fact that large amount of competitive adsorption prevented simultaneous adsorption of the metals, each of the metal concentration of bimetallic NPs for co-SEA should be adjusted [16]. The metal loadings of catalysts prepared via DI showed in Table 1 are similar with the catalysts synthesized by SEA. According to Table 1 and Fig. S1, it is suggested that the catalysts maintain the high SBET of the SiO2 support after the metal loading. However, all the bimetallic catalysts prepared by co-SEA exhibit lower surface area and higher pore volume than that prepared by co-DI. This is attributed to the highly dispersed metals of co-SEA catalysts anchored on the surface of support silica and decreased the surface area, whereas the metals of co-DI catalysts are agglomerated and filled into the pores of the support. Besides, as determined by CO pulse chemisorption, the dispersion of Pd on the catalysts based on SEA method are more than twice as much as the catalysts based on DI method in the analogous metal loadings, indicating the exist of highly exposed and well-dispersed bimetallic NPs for SEA Pd-M/SiO2 catalysts. Fig. 2 a shows the broad peak observed around 21° 2θ is belong to the SiO2 (220) crystal peak. For the DI samples, all the strong diffraction peaks of metal NPs are detected between 2θ of 30° and 50° (Fig. S2a). The intense XRD peaks at 2θ of 40.1°, 46.6° and 68.1° for Pd/SiO2 are Pd (111), Pd (200) and Pd (220) respectively, and the very broad peaks of bimetallic catalysts can be deconvoluted into Ni (200) at 2θ of 67.8°, Co (002 and 101) at 2θ of 44.3°and 47.3°, Cu (111) at 2θ of 43.2° and Pt (111 and 200) peaks at 2θ of 39.9° and 46.4°. All the non-Gaussian shape of peaks with shoulders and sharp centers in Fig. S2a prove a wide particle size distribution and varying phase compositions, which containing large amount metals and a few alloys [16]. Furthermore, the DI samples in Fig. S2b–f reveal that the metals are agglomerated with broader particle size distributions in the range of 10–25 nm, which are consistent with the XRD results. Correspondingly, the diffraction peaks of SEA catalysts are not detected in Fig. 2a due to the high dispersion of metal NPs [27]. Moreover, in Fig. 2b–f, it is observed that the SEA metallic NPs with uniform size of about 1.0–2.0 nm are well dispersed on the SiO2 support. It also explains the fact that the dispersion of Pd-M/SiO2 catalysts via SEA method is more than twice as much as the catalysts based on DI method. Therefore, based on the electrostatic adsorption by regulating pH values, the catalyst via SEA method yields more uniformly tight size-distribution and more exposed metallic sites, which might potentially show better catalytic hydrogenation performance than the catalysts via DI method. In addition, we have supplied energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) in spot mode on multiple individual bimetallic NPs produced by co-SEA in Tables S1–S4. According to comparing the nominal weight ratios with the actual weight ratios determined through ICP-AES, the composition of Pd and M species can be determined. The weight percent (wt %) and weight ratio of the two metals will vary depending on their molecular weights. In Tables S1–S4, most of individual NPs are near the predicted wt % for each metal, indicating the co-SEA catalysts are synthesized with the expected ratio. 3.2 Surface composition and chemical state of the Pd/SiO2 and Pd-M/SiO2 NPs catalysts Fig. 3 a shows the TPR profiles of the Pd-M/SiO2 catalysts. For Pd/SiO2 catalyst, the reduction of PdO in the DI sample occurs at a low temperature of 128 °C while at 174 °C for reduction of SEA sample. It indicates a stronger interaction existed between monometallic Pd and the support silica for SEA Pd/SiO2. In addition, the high temperature reduction peak at 340 °C for SEA Pd/SiO2 represents the reduction of palladium ions (-PdOx) that strongly bonds with the surface silanol group (OH) of silica [41], whereas the reduction peak at 314 °C in DI may attributed to the lower interaction between Pd species and support silica. Among the bimetallic catalysts, all the first reduction peaks at ∼200 °C for co-SEA Pd-M/SiO2 are higher than the temperature of monometallic Pd. This is attributed to the bimetallic reduction peaks, which proving the synthesis of alloys of Pd-Ni, Pd-Co, Pd-Cu and Pd-Pt NPs. Further evidences of bimetallic alloys formations are observed for the hydrogen spillover occurred on co-SEA catalysts in high temperature reduction peaks. The Ni, Cu, Co, and Pt complexes require high temperature for reduction over silica, yet alloying of Pd-Ni, Pd-Cu Pd-Co and Pd-Pt reduction temperature shift to lower temperature to hydrogen spillover from Pd to unreduced promoter metallic complexes. However, the first reduction peaks of co-DI NPs remaining at the range of 120–160 °C belong to the monometallic Pd peak rather than the alloy peak. Besides, the bimetallic co-DI NPs contain broader peaks and more reducible complexes that corresponded to the nonshifted monometallic Pd and promoter metals. Therefore, unalloyed metals exist in DI Pd/M-SiO2 and then prove the synthesis of different metallic NP compositions. Figs. 3b and S4b show the Pd 3d spectra of the Pd-M/SiO2 catalysts prepared by SEA and DI method, respectively. It is notable that the BE of Pd 3d3/2 and Pd 3d5/2 of SEA NPs are all higher than that of DI NPs. It suggests that due to the strong metal-support interaction between the metallic Pd and support silica for the SEA Pd-M/SiO2 catalysts, lots of Pd species tend to donate electron to support silica and change the molecular orbital of Pd 3d. This is consistent with the results of H2-TPR in Fig. 3a. Besides, Pd (1.58) has a lower electronegativity than Pt (1.72), Ni (1.88), Cu (1.85) and Co (1.84) [42], the promoter metals tend to get electrons from Pd species in different degrees. Besides, the higher Pt loading may prompt a positive BE shift from Pd to Pt due to the low Pd/M weight ratios may influence the shift degrees of Pd BEs [43]. As a result, the degree of electron-deficient for Pd species in co-SEA catalysts increases in the sequence of Pd-Co/SiO2 < Pd-Cu/SiO2 < Pd-Pt/SiO2 < Pd-Ni/SiO2. In addition, Fig. 4 shows the fine spectra of promoter metallic Pt 4f, Ni 2p, Cu 2p and Co 2p. Compared with the co-DI bimetallic catalysts, all BEs of promoter species derived from co-SEA shift close to the BEs of Pd 3d orbitals due to the tight combination between Pd-M (M = Pt, Ni, Cu, Co) alloys. It suggests that the co-SEA catalysts show a higher alloyed degree than the co-DI catalysts. 3.3 Hydrogenation of benzene and toluene A literature survey of the catalytic performance of aromatics hydrogenation in recent years is summarized in Table S5. The table gives a series of preparation method of catalysts with different metals and supports and their catalytic hydrogenation performance. It is notable that these catalysts show a lower hydrogenation performance (TOFs) under similar reaction conditions with this work. This may be due to the lower metallic atom utilization and dispersion. Table 2 presents the catalytic activities performance of the toluene and benzene hydrogenation for the catalysts prepared via SEA and DI method. The reaction time of 6 h is selected as pattern to collect the catalytic activities and it shows a similar catalytic trend for toluene and benzene hydrogenation. Methylcyclohexane and cyclohexane are the only detected products respectively for the complete hydrogenation reaction. The obtained results show that the SEA Pd-M/SiO2 catalysts are more active than DI Pd-M/SiO2 catalysts from toluene to methylcyclohexane and from benzene to cyclohexane in the same reaction time. Fig. S5 shows the time courses of toluene and benzene hydrogenation over the SEA Pd-Ni/SiO2 and DI Pd-Ni/SiO2 catalysts. It is known that benzene and toluene hydrogenation are as first order relative to benzene and toluene on the Pd catalysts respectively, which is confirmed on the Pd-M/SiO2 catalysts by the linear relationships between the natural logarithms of benzene and toluene contents and t (Fig. S6) [43]. The surface coverage of benzene and toluene will influence the reaction rate. The hydrogenation conversion of the SEA catalysts is nearly three times as much as the catalysts synthesized via DI method, which is due to the SEA Pd-M/SiO2 catalysts produce more highly exposed and uniformly dispersed metallic Pd sites on the surface of support silica than the DI Pd-M/SiO2 catalysts. This is consistent with the XRD and STEM results in Fig. 2. Besides, the TOFs of toluene and benzene over the catalysts are calculated based on the r0 and dispersion data shown in Table 2 since the conversion is insufficient of representing the intrinsic hydrogenation performance for individual Pd metallic site. In a study by Yang [44], the molecular width, thickness and length of benzene is 0.66 nm, 0.32 nm and 0.73 nm, which is slightly smaller than the 0.66 nm, 0.40 nm and 0.82 nm of toluene. The Pd-M/SiO2 catalysts show higher TOFs for benzene hydrogenation than toluene hydrogenation. This is due to smaller size benzene molecular are more largely adsorbed on the surface of catalysts than toluene. The holistic TOFs of SEA Pd-M/SiO2 catalysts are about twice that of the DI Pd-M/SiO2 catalysts, confirming the effect of promoter metals should be taken into consideration. Taimoor and Pitault [45] proposed a kinetic research about the gas phase hydrogenation of toluene on Pt catalysts. The authors conduced that metallic sites as well cationic sites (metal-support interaction) play a crucial role in the reaction. The H2 would be adsorbed on metallic Pt sites that highly dispersed on the surface of support. On the other hand, the π system of benzene (toluene) was electron-rich delocalized (−0.236e per C atom), it should be easy for benzene (toluene) to adsorb on the electron-deficient sites. Therefore, in view of the higher alloyed degrees and more highly dispersed metallic Pd sites for SEA catalysts than the DI catalysts, the SEA Pd species possess plenty of Pdδ+/Pd sites and then show higher TOFs than DI Pd species. In addition, the TOFs for SEA Pd-M/SiO2 catalysts increase in the sequence of Pd-Co/SiO2 < Pd-Cu/SiO2 < Pd-Pt/SiO2 < Pd-Ni/SiO2, which is correspond to the trend of electron-deficient degrees for SEA Pd species. 3.4 Implications of in-situ characterization on hydrogenation Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy with CO adsorption behavior for the Pd-M/SiO2 catalysts prepared via SEA and co-SEA method is further investigated to study the local environment of metallic Pd and promoter metals (Fig. 5 a). For SEA Pd NPs, the IR bands at ∼2070 and ∼1890 cm−1 can be ascribed to atop-bonded CO on Pd° sites and bridged adsorption of CO on two Pd atoms, respectively, which the formation of bridged-bonded CO indicates the CO adsorbed on the interface between Pd NPs and the support silica [46]. It is notable that the SEA Pd/SiO2 catalyst shows a lower bridge-bonded CO band at 1890 cm−1 than the CO band at 1954 cm−1 for Pd/SiO2 reported by literature [47] that then proves the existence of highly dispersed small Pd sites. For bimetallic catalysts Pd-M/SiO2 prepared by co-SEA (Fig. 5a), the linearly bonded CO peaks shift to low frequency from 2080 cm−1 to 2062 cm−1. This is attributed to the direct interaction between the doping metals and metallic Pd [48], indicating the formation of Pd-M alloys. Besides, the bridge CO peak is very sensitive to the promoter metals. The two strong bridge vibration band at 1942 and 1948 cm−1 for Pd-Ni/SiO2 catalyst and Pd-Pt/SiO2 catalyst respectively show a Pd-like feature [43]. However, the two weak bridge CO bands at 1870 cm−1 and 1974 cm−1 for Pd-Co/SiO2 and Pd-Cu/SiO2 catalyst exhibit a Co-like and Cu-like feature, respectively [49]. Fig. 5b and c show the desorption temperature of SEA Pd-M/SiO2 catalysts are higher than that of DI Pd-M/SiO2 catalysts by ∼5 °C for both toluene- and benzene-TPD profiles. It is attributes to the strong interaction between the electron-rich aromatic compounds and electron-deficient Pdδ+ sites. In addition, in view of the highly dispersed metallic Pd sites of SEA catalysts, the amounts of aromatics adsorbed on the SEA catalysts are about 1.5 times as that of the DI catalysts. This indicates the aromatic molecules adsorb more largely and strongly on SEA than that on DI catalysts. Besides, the addition of promoter metals Ni and Pt promote the adsorption of aromatics molecules for the Pd catalysts and produce a high hydrogenation rate. Therefore, the SEA Pd-Ni/SiO2 catalyst shows highest TOFs of 3.2 s−1 for toluene hydrogenation as well as 3.7 s−1 for benzene hydrogenation, respectively, whereas the DI Pd/SiO2 catalyst shows lowest TOFs of 0.4 s−1 for toluene hydrogenation as well as 0.3 s−1 for benzene hydrogenation, respectively. 3.5 The stability of catalysts The toluene and benzene hydrogenation recycling performances on Pd-Ni/SiO2 prepared by co-SEA and co-DI are shown in Fig. 6 . As expected, the co-SEA Pd-Ni/SiO2 catalyst exhibits better recyclability in the reaction, and no obvious fading for TOFs in six reaction cycles, whereas the co-DI Pd-Ni/SiO2 catalyst shows a steady attenuation after six runs. For SEA Pd-Ni/SiO2 catalysts, the less decrease of the catalytic conversion may be derived from the material loss during every catalyst regeneration steps, which still keeping remarkable cycling stability. For DI Pd-Ni/SiO2 catalysts, the sharply decrease of the catalytic conversion is attributed to the loss of active metals due to the weak metal-support interaction and metallic aggregation according to the Fig. S7. Furthermore, the size and distribution of Pd NPs prepared by co-SEA coated with SiO2 remains almost unchanged after six reaction cycles based on the XRD results, indicating that the Pd-M/SiO2 catalysts prepared by co-SEA are a promising candidate for practical application (Fig. S5). 4 Conclusions In summary, the Pd-M/SiO2 (M = Pt, Ni, Cu, Co) catalysts with highly exposed and well dispersed Pd-M alloy NPs are successfully synthesized by the Strong Electrostatic Adsorption (SEA) method. Due to there are larger amounts of electron-deficient Pdδ+ sites that evenly dispersed on the surface of SEA Pd-M/SiO2 catalysts resulting from strong metal support interaction between the metallic Pd and the support silica, more electron-rich aromatics can be adsorbed and activated. Therefore, the intrinsic catalytic hydrogenation activities of SEA catalysts are nearly twice as that of the DI catalysts. The SEA Pd-Ni/SiO2 catalyst shows the highest TOF of the 3.7 and 3.2 s−1 for benzene and toluene hydrogenation, respectively. The TOF of SEA Pd-Ni/SiO2 catalyst has no significant attenuation after six runs. The remarkable hydrogenation activity and cycling stability of the co-SEA catalysts demonstrates the superiority for industrial catalytic hydrogenation of aromatic compounds.

        "dc:description": "Herein, we reported an effective method to synthesis a series of supported bimetallic Pd-M/SiO2 (M = Pt, Ni, Cu, Co) catalysts with highly exposed and well-alloyed nanoparticles via simultaneous strong electrostatic adsorption (co-SEA), which controlled metal precursors strongly anchored onto the oppositely charged support (SiO2) by changing the pH relative to the surface point of zero charge (PZC). The toluene and benzene hydrogenation were used as probe reactions to evaluate the catalytic hydrogenation activity performance of the Pd-M/SiO2 catalysts. Compared to the catalysts synthesized by the common technique simultaneous dry impregnation (co-DI), the co-SEA Pd-Ni/SiO2 catalyst exhibited the highest turnover frequencies (TOFs) of 3.7 s−1 for benzene hydrogenation and 3.2 s−1 for toluene hydrogenation. This was attributed to the large amount of electron-deficient Pdδ+ sites on the surface of SEA Pd-M/SiO2 that easily for electron-rich benzene and toluene to adsorb. Besides, the co-SEA catalysts produced well stability and reusability without significant decrease in the catalytic activity after six runs.",
