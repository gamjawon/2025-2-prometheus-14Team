Institute of Environmental and Energy Catalysis School of Materials Science and Chemical Engineering Xi'an Technological University Xi'an 710021 China Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with explicit metal-nitrogen-carbon moieties have attracted extensive attention over the past decade. Yet, understanding their catalytic origin toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) remains a great task due to the complicated coordination environment surrounding the active center. Here, we employed large scale density functional theory computations to examine the OER/ORR performance on 144 heteroatom-doped SACs (X-TMN4@Gra, TM=Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Rh, Ir, X = B, N, O, P, S). Computational results unveiled the significant role of heteroatom doping in affecting the local electronic properties of TM centers and their catalytic activity, even leading to the transition of potential limiting steps. Machine learning (ML) enabled to delve deeper into the correlation between atomic characteristics and catalytic activity, suggesting that ΔG OOH* and ΔG O*-OH* can serve as vital descriptors for anticipating ORR and OER performance, respectively. These revelations not only elucidate the catalytic discrepancy of reported SACs but provide a rational way to optimize secondary coordination of SACs, thus paving new opportunities to discover the high-performance electrocatalysts.

Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) represents two typical processes that play crucial roles in the operation of fuel cells and metal-air batteries [7]. Until now, platinum and its alloy have served as catalysts for ORR, whereas metal oxides/hydroxides of iridium, ruthenium, nickel and other metals have been employed for OER [7,8]. Unfortunately, their commercialization has been significantly impeded by their scarcity and the sluggish kinetics for both ORR and OER [9,10]. Therefore, it is of paramount significance and urgency to devise non-precious, more efficient, and enduring alternative bifunctional catalysts for OER/ORR. Among the non-precious metal catalysts, transition metals–nitrogen (TM-N) doped graphene (TMNx@Gra) single-atom catalysts (SACs) have garnered considerable attention as highly promising bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts, owing to their remarkable activity[11,12]. Extensive investigations have unequivocally clarified that the ORR in N-doped graphene occurs predominantly via a four-electron reaction mechanism, thereby indicating its highly efficient catalytic selectivity [13]. For example, Wu et al. [14] meticulously modulated the iron content in precursors to synthesize an FeNx@carbon SAC, demonstrating performance comparable to commercial Pt/C in acidic electrolytes. Furthermore, Wu et al. [15] derived a high-performance Co–N–C SAC from cobalt-based metal-organic frameworks, which displayed remarkable activity and stability during fuel cell evaluations. Xue et al. [16] conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the OER/ORR electrocatalytic activity of the TMN4@carbon system through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Their results identified IrN4@carbon as an exceptionally promising bifunctional catalyst for both OER and ORR, possessing exceptionally low overpotentials of 0.30 V and 0.26 V, respectively. The precisely coordinated TMNx centers, particularly the TMN4 configurations (TM is tetrahedrally coordinated by four N atoms), are considered to be stable and efficient ORR/OER catalytic active sites [17,18]. These nitrogen atoms serve not only as anchoring points for stabilizing individual metal atoms but also play a crucial role in modulating the electronic structures of these active sites. In addition, by tuning the first coordination atom and second coordination environment of the active sites, the electrocatalytic activity can be precisely tailored. For instance, the incorporation of foreign atoms, such as sulfur or phosphorus, into the core structures leads to alterations in the coordinated atomic arrangement, profoundly influencing the electronic configuration of the central metal atom, and enhancing the electrocatalytic activity [19–25]. As a result, various SACs with different coordination have been developed, such as Fe SACs supported on N, S-doped carbon, S doped FexC/Fe and NiNx SACs [19,20,25]. Fang et al. [26] present a novel and stable holey graphene-like carbon nitride monolayer, g-C16N5 (N4@g-C16N3), to systematically explore the electrocatalytic activity of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), OER, and ORR. Their study reveals that the synergistic modulation of hydrogen (H-) loading and oxygen (O-) coordination effectively tunes the adsorption strength of the respective adsorbates, thereby enhancing the overall performance in HER, OER, and ORR. Notably, Co, B, and N doped graphene exhibit remarkable comprehensive performance in terms of activity, methanol tolerance, and durability, surpassing even the benchmark commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst [27]. Furthermore, S-doped Co-N-C catalysts also exhibit exceptional ORR activity. Chen et al. [28] have pioneered a scalable and facile pyrolysis approach, yielding ultra-small cobalt nanoparticles uniformly embedded within a layered graphene carbon nanostructure (Co@NSC), boasting an exceptionally high positive half-wave potential of 0.82 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). We note that though pioneer workers demonstrated that the electronic state of metal active sites can be adjusting by doping heteroatoms in the first, second, and even higher coordination spheres of metal atoms, the activity origin related to these catalysts remains elusive at the atomic level, due to the great complexity of local configuration near the active sites. The effects and mechanisms of heteroatom doping on the catalyst require further exploration. This work reported a comprehensive picture of TMN4@Graphene (TMN4@Gra; TM = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Rh, Ir) toward the ORR and OER by introducing heteroatoms (B, C, N, O, P, S, etc.) into the second or higher coordination sphere of the metal active site. Combing large scale DFT computations with data-driven technology-assisted machine learning (ML) [29], we uncovered the underlying correlation between the physical and chemical properties of various heteroatoms doped TMN4@Gra systems and their catalytic efficacy towards ORR/OER. This work addresses a critical issue of understanding the catalytic origin of experimental available SACs and provides a general principle to rational design of high-performance SACs. 2 Computational methods and details 2.1 DFT calculations The spin-polarized DFT methodology was employed for all computations, utilizing the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) [30–32]. To delineate ion-electron interactions, we adopted the projector-augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotentials, and the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functionals within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) framework were utilized to assess electronic exchange-correlation effects [33]. To account for van der Waals interactions between reaction intermediates and the catalyst, Grimme's DFT-D3 method was incorporated [34]. For Brillouin zone integration, the Monkhorst-Pack k-point scheme was adopted, with a 3 × 3 × 1 centered grid for structural relaxation and a 9 × 9 × 1 grid for electronic property calculations [35]. The plane wave computations employed a cutoff energy of 400 eV The convergence criteria for energy and atomic forces were set at 10−6 eV/atom and 0.05 eV/Å, respectively. A 5 × 5 supercell comprising 50 C atoms was constructed as the pristine graphene substrate, and a 20 Å vacuum layer in the z-direction was appended to mitigate interlayer interactions. Bader charge analysis was employed to characterize charge redistributions [36]. The X-TMN4@Gra (TM = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Rh, Ir) systems were constructed by three steps. Initially, the fabrication process entailed the elimination of two adjacent C atoms from the pristine graphene substrate, thereby creating a divacancy model. Subsequently, a TM atom was positioned at the center of the divacancy, along with the substitution of four N atoms for the C atoms that directly adjacent to the TM dopant. Finally, heteroatoms (including B, N, O, P, S) were introduced in proximity to the first and second coordination spheres of the TM-N4 active center, replacing the C atom. The structure of X-TMN4@Gra is depicted in Fig. 1(a) , with six heteroatom-doped sites enumerated in Fig. S1 in the supporting information (SI). To assess the relative stability of the X-TMN4@Gra systems, the formation energy (E f) was calculated, and the details of these calculations are provided in Note S9 and Table S1 in the SI. 2.2 Machine learning The machine learning (ML) method was implemented utilizing the Scikit-learn [37] package in the Python3.7 environment. Five distinct supervised algorithms were selected for model construction, including Gradient Boosted Regression (GBR) [38], Random Forest Regression (RFR) [39], Support Vector Regression (SVR) [40], Ridge [41] and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) [42]. Detailed descriptions of these algorithms are provided in Notes S1-S5. During the model training process, the original data obtained from DFT calculations were randomly shuffled and partitioned into a training set and a test set with a 4:1 ratio. To mitigate overfitting, eliminate sampling error, and ensure model generalization, 4-fold cross-validation was employed for each ML model [43]. The performance of the models was evaluated using two metrics: the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and the coefficient of determination (R² score), as outlined in Note S6. The RMSE quantifies the average error of the model, while the R² score reflects the model's accuracy. Consequently, a superior ML model exhibits a lower RMSE and a higher R² score. Additionally, the mean absolute error (MAE) was calculated to assess the discrepancy between the DFT-calculated values and the ML-predicted values. To ensure consistent analysis, normalization was performed on the original dataset, scaling the values to a range between 0 and 1 [44]. The methodology for determining feature importance is detailed in Note S7. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Geometric structure and stability Fig. 1(a) and (b) illustrate the mechanism diagram for doping heteroatoms in the TMN4@Gra systems, while Fig. S1 presents the optimized structures and doping sites of heteroatoms. The relative stability of the X-TMN4@Gra systems was initially assessed by examining their formation energy (E f), as depicted in Fig. 1(d). Notably, nearly all X-TMN4@Gra samples exhibit negative E f values, signifying that the embedding of heteroatoms into the TMN4@Gra structure is energetically favorable. Only a subset of the N-doped and O-doped samples exhibit positive E f less than 1 eV, indicating potential thermodynamic instability and the necessity for more stringent fabrication conditions. Furthermore, the formation energy analysis suggests that the heteroatoms are more likely to substitute the carbon atoms surrounding the TM. For example, it is difficult for O to replace the C atom at the O3-O6 sites. The E f values for P- doping and S- doping are much smaller than that of O doping, indicating that P atom and S atom are easier to be doped into the coordination sites of the second or even higher coordination sphere of TMN4@Gra systems. Given the profound interest in exploring the potential applications of X-TMN4@Gra systems as efficient ORR/OER electrocatalysts, a rigorous assessment of their stability under realistic electrochemical conditions is paramount. To address this issue, we calculated the dissolution potential (U diss) of single atom sites in the X-TMN4@Gra systems in an acidic environments (pH = 0) [45,46], with further computational details provided in Table S2 and Fig. S2. Fortuitously, our findings indicate that the computed U diss values for almost all X-CoN4@Gra, X-RhN4@Gra, X-IrN4@Gra are positive, implying their resilience to experimental ORR/OER conditions. Conversely, the negative U diss values observed for N-doped systems with N1-N6 sites, O-doped SACs with O3-O6 sites, and B-doped SACs with B3-B6 sites in X-FeN4@Gra, X-CoN4@Gra, X-NiN4@Gra, which suggest their instability toward dissolution. Notably, there exists a positive correlation between the atomic number of the TM and its dissolution stability, indicating an enhancement in stability with increasing atomic number in studied SACs, as evident from Fig. S3. 3.2 OER/ORR catalytic activity The overpotentials of ORR and OER on X-TMN4@Gra are also summarized in Fig. 2 . As expected, the overpotentials fluctuate with the difference of doping heteroatoms and doping sites. However, only limited heteroatom-doped structures tend to be positively regulated, and their limiting potential is as expected lower than that of the intrinsic material. Among X-FeN4@Gra systems, it can be seen that P1-FeN4@Gra exhibits the lowest OER overpotential (η OER = 0.589 V) and S1-FeN4@Gra demonstrates the lowest ORR overpotential (η ORR = 0.577 V) [47]. For X-CoN4@Gra systems, S3-CoN4@Gra possesses the lowest OER overpotential (η OER = 0.188 V) and P4-CoN4@Gra displays the satisfied ORR overpotential (η ORR = 0.225 V). And for X-(Ni, Cu, Rh, Ir)N4@Gra systems, the lowest OER overpotential systems are O1-NiN4@Gra, O3-CuN4@Gra, S2-RhN4@Gra, S1-IrN4@Gra, respectively and the lowest ORR overpotential systems are O2-NiN4@Gra, S4-CuN4@Gra, P5-RhN4@Gra, S2-IrN4@Gra, respectively. It is evident that the influence of heteroatom doping on the OER activity of X-FeN4@Gra systems is notably more profound than its effect on ORR. Conversely, the impact of heteroatom doping on the ORR activity of X-NiN4@Gra systems is significantly greater than its influence on OER. However, for X-(Ni, Cu, Rh, Ir)N4@Gra systems, the effect of heteroatom doping on both ORR and OER activities is balanced. Notably, the η OER and η ORR values of these heteroatoms doped systems are even lower than those of pristine TMN4@Gra systems, indicating that heteroatoms doped can improve the catalytic activity of TMN4@Gra systems. In agreement with our computational results, experiments demonstrated that P, S doped FeN4@Gra [21,48,49], S doped CuN4@Gra [50], P, S doped CoNx@Gra [51] to have improved ORR and OER performance. Furthermore, the free energy diagrams for the OER and ORR of the systems with the lowest overpotential are depicted in Fig. S5. The ORR progression proceeds from left to right, encompassing the stages of *O2, *OOH, *O, *OH and *H2O, whereas the OER progression occurs in the opposite direction since these processes are reciprocal. As observed in Fig. S5, the OER and ORR pathways are hindered at specific stages, representing rate-limiting steps. For instance, in the case of P1-FeN4@Gra, the OER process is rate-limited by the third step, specifically the transition from *O → *OOH, whereas the ORR process encounters a hindrance during the transition from *OH → *H2O. Other rate-limiting steps for the systems with the lowest overpotential are also indicated in the diagram. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the ORR and OER performance on the X-TMN4@Gra, we calculated the adsorption energies and free energies of *OH, *O, and *OOH on X-TMN4@Gra, and the detailed computational methodologies are outlined in Note S8. The results are tabulated in Tables S3–S8. According to prior research, the analogous TM−O bonding between the TM and the intermediates (*OH, *O, and *OOH) often results in similar adsorption behaviors of these intermediates on metal surfaces [52]. Specifically, the adsorption energies of *OH, *O, and *OOH on catalysts tend to exhibit comparable trends, showing a so-called adsorption linear scaling relation. As depicted in Figs. 3(a) and S4, the scaling relationships between the adsorption energies of *OH, *O, and *OOH validate this observation in the context of X-TMN4@Gra systems. The adsorption energies of the intermediates are simultaneously changed with the doping of heteroatoms, rendering a similar adsorption correlation on X-TMN4@Gra systems. Since the catalytic activity of ORR/OER catalysts is closely tied to the adsorption strength of the intermediates, and the tunable adsorption energy of the intermediates through heteroatom doping suggests that the heteroatoms can delicately regulate the catalytic activity of the X-TMN4@Gra systems. To further understand how the adsorption of reaction species affect the overpotential, we then employed ΔG *OH as an descriptor for estimating the ORR catalytic activity of the X-TMN4@Gra systems, in terms of the strong correlation between ΔG *OH and ΔG *OOH/ΔG *O (Figs. 3(a) and S4). The ηORR as a function of ΔG *OH is depicted in Fig. 3(c). A clear volcano curve can be established with the optimal ΔG *OH near the 1.10 eV. In particular, for the same metal center with different doping configuration, the ΔG *OH values are changed greatly, demonstrating the notably ability of heteroatoms doping to regulate the ORR performance of TMN4@Gra systems. In addition, the strong correlation between ΔG *OH and η ORR in X-FeN4@Gra, X-RhN4@Gra and X-IrN4@Gra systems indicates that the effects of heteroatoms introduction on these three systems are more easily predicted. On the contrary, the fluctuating η ORR on the X-CoN4@Gra, X-NiN4@Gra and X-CuN4@Gra suggests that the catalytic activity of these systems will also change with the introduction of heteroatoms, however, the regulation of catalysts has a certain unpredictability. Regarding OER, ΔG O*-OH* is typically employed as a descriptor to characterize the OER catalytic performance across various electrocatalysts [53,54]. A robust correlation exists between the magnitude of ΔG O*-OH* and the η OER in the X-TMN4@Gra systems, as evidenced in Fig. 3(d). Similar to relation of η ORR with ΔG *OH, the ΔG O*-*OH in the X-TMN4@Gra systems has a strong influence on the η OER and the OER performance of TMN4@Gra systems is perfectly demonstrated by the activity volcano diagram. It should be noted that the regulate of the introduction of heteroatoms on the OER activity of X-FeN4@Gra and X-CoN4@Gra systems is uncertain. To gain a deeper insight into effect of surface adsorption on the catalytic activity, we plotted two-dimensional volcano plots of ORR as the function of ΔG *OH and ΔG * O −ΔG* OH (Fig. 4(a) ). The red region on the two-dimensional volcano plot highlights the zone of highest activity, where η ORR attains a minimal value of 0.19 V under the optimal condition of ΔG a = ΔG b = ΔG c = ΔG d, where (1) Δ G a = Δ G * OH , (2) Δ G b = Δ G * O − Δ G * O H , (3) Δ G c = 1.922 − Δ G a * 0.889 , (4) Δ G d = 2.998 − Δ G b − 0.111 Δ G a . Evidently, the counter-map is divided into four distinct regions. These regions correspond to the systems with different potential-determining steps (PDSs). As depicted in Fig. 4(a) and (b), the entire contour map is segmented into four areas, representing the free energy variations of the four fundamental steps of ORR. Notably, a sample point situated on the boundary between two adjacent regions signifies the existence of two PDSs during the ORR process. For X-FeN4@Gra systems, the PDS of ORR corresponds to the *OH → H2O reactions, while the PDS for OER corresponds to the *O→*OOH reactions. In the case of X-NiN4@Gra systems, the PDS for ORR aligns with the *O2→*OOH reactions, whereas the PDS for OER encompasses the *OH→*O and *H2O→*OH reactions. And for X-(Co, Cu, Rh, Ir)N4@Gra systems, the PDS for ORR associated with the *OH → H2O reactions and *O2→*OOH. The PDS for OER in these systems comprises the *OH→*O, *H2O→*OH, *O→*OOH, and *OOH → *O2 paths. As expected, the fine-tuning for the adsorption energy of the intermediates by heteroatoms doping indicate that the heteroatoms can effectively regulate the catalytic activity of the X-TMN4@Gra. This fine-tuning will not only affect the catalytic activity of the catalyst, but also affect the limiting step of the X-TMN4@Gra systems. To unveiled spatial distribution of the doping site and elements in affecting catalytic activity, the overpotential variations were analyzed using mathematical statistics (see Figs. 4 (e, f), S6, S7). The horizontal axis of the box plot depicts the doping sites, whereas the vertical axis represents the overpotential of ORR/OER. Notably, the vertical length of the box signifies the extent of overpotential variation in the TMN4@Gra system when heteroatoms are doped at a specific site. The black line running parallel to the horizontal axis within the box serves as the statistical median line, indicating the median overpotential when heteroatoms are doped at that specific site. A smaller median signifies a more favorable average influence of that site on the overpotential of the X-TMN4@Gra systems. As depicted in Fig. S6(a), for the ORR reaction, the effect of the overpotential augmentation gradually intensifies as the doping distance increases. In particular, when the heteroatoms are doped at site 1 and site 2, the closest sites to the transition metal center, the range of overpotential variation in the X-TMN4@Gra systems is minimal, indicating a lower adjustment. The statistical median line highlights that the average limiting potential is lowest when the heteroatom is doped at site 4. Fig. S6(b) demonstrates that the impact of heteroatoms doping on the overpotential of the TMN4@Gra systems is comparable when doping occurs in both zigzag and armchair directions. As seen in Fig. S6(c), for the OER reaction, there is no discernible pattern in the effect of heteroatom doping on the range of overpotential. Specifically, when doped at site 1, the system exhibits the narrowest range of overpotential variation and the lowest adjustment extent. The statistical median line indicates that the average limiting potential is lowest when the heteroatoms are doped at site 5. Fig. S6(d) reveals that the influence of heteroatoms on the range of overpotential variation in the armchair-doped system is lesser than in the zigzag-doped system. However, the statistical median line suggests that the average limiting potential is lowest when the heteroatom is doped in the zigzag direction. The distribution of statistical median lines in Fig. S7 indicates that, for different TM active centers, the ORR average limiting potential is lowest for the B4-, N6-, O6-, P6-, and S5-TMN4@Gra configurations, while the OER average limiting potential is lowest for the B5, N4, O4, P3, and S5-TMN4@Gra configurations. The ORR overpotential exhibits the smallest variation range for the B4, N1, O4, P4, and S1-TMN4@Gra configurations, whereas the OER overpotential shows the least variation range for the B5, N4, O1, P1, and S3-TMN4@Gra configurations. Overall, the regulation of catalytic activity in the TMN4@Gra systems is influenced differently by various dopant elements and doping sites, with the modulation effect of O element being more stable. Fig. 4(e) and 4(f) illustrate the effect of doping elements on the overpotential in ORR and OER using box and violin plots. The statistical analysis reveals that for both ORR and OER, O atom doping exhibits the narrowest adjustment range on the system's overpotential. S atom doping demonstrates the most significant regulatory effect on the ORR overpotential, whereas B atom doping has the greatest regulatory influence on the OER overpotential. Furthermore, the statistical median line indicates that S and O doping have the optimal regulatory effects on the ORR and OER overpotentials, respectively. 3.3 Electronic origin To further elucidate the impact of electronic properties on catalytic activity, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the projected density of states (PDOSs) for the X-TMN4@Gra catalysts, (see Figs. 4 and S8). Fig. 4(c) and (d) specifically illustrates the PDOS of Fe in S-FeN4@Gra catalysts with different doping sites. After the doping of heteroatoms, the d band of the TM will produce a slight shift, thus changing the local electronic properties of the active center of the TMN4@Gra and fine-tuning the adsorption strength between the TM and the intermediates. In addition, Fig. 4(d) shown the relationship between the TM d band center (ε d) and the reaction intermediates in the X-FeN4@Gra systems. It is obvious that the adsorption energy of the three intermediates shows the same trend with the change of transition metal d band center. It is further proved that heteroatoms doped in the second further coordination sphere can affect the adsorption strength of the reaction intermediates by weakly adjusting the local electronic properties of the TM, thus fine-tuning the catalytic activity of the system. The PDOS and the relationship between the ε d and the adsorption energies of intermediates of the others S-TMN4@Gra shown similar results, as can be seen in Fig. S8. 3.4 Thermal stability of X-TMN4@Gra Besides the catalytic activity, it is of importance to ascertain the structural stability of X-TMN4@Gra systems at working conditions. Thus, we conducted thermodynamic stability evaluations employing ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. The simulations were carried out using the Nose-Hoover thermostat model implemented in VASP on a 5 × 5 supercell to mitigate the effects of periodic boundary conditions. The simulations were performed within the canonical ensemble at 600 K for a duration of 10 ps, with a time step of 1 fs. As depicted in Fig. S9, the systems energy of S1-FeN4@Gra, P1-FeN4@Gra, P4-CoN4@Gra, S3-CoN4@Gra, O2-NiN4@Gra, O1-NiN4@Gra, S4-CuN4@Gra, O3-CuN4@Gra, P5-RhN4@Gra, P2-RhN4@Gra, S2-IrN4@Gra, and S1-IrN4@Gra remained stable over the 10 ps simulation period at 600 K, exhibiting slight fluctuations. Notably, throughout the simulations at 600 K, the X-TMN4@Gra systems retained their two-dimensional planar structure, albeit with minor perturbations in the vertical direction of their constituent atoms. As evidenced in Fig. S9, all other X-TMN4@Gra systems exhibited similar thermodynamic stability during AIMD simulations. Consequently, our AIMD simulations predict that X-TMN4@Gra systems can maintain high thermodynamic stability at temperatures up to 600 K. 3.5 Machine learning training Finally, the ML methodology was harnessed to expedite the screening process, enabling swift prediction of the ORR and OER catalytic proficiency of a diverse array of X-TMN4@Gra catalysts. The properties of 13 theoretically calculated features about X-TMN4@Gra systems were selected as input data for ML, which representing material properties and reflecting the interaction strength of reaction intermediates [55]. The input data contains 13 descriptors represented material properties and reflected the interaction strength of reaction intermediates, such as ΔG O*, ΔG OH*, ΔG OOH*, ΔG O*-OH*, ΔG OOH*-O*, ΔG 4.92-OOH*, the d-band center (ε d), the valence-band center (ε val), the charge transfer of TM atoms (Qe), the number of TM-d electrons (e d), the number of valence electrons (e val), the product of transition metal electronegativity and e d, and the product of transition metal electronegativity and e val. The adsorption energy of reaction intermediates and other chemical properties of TM atoms are derived from DFT computations. Utilizing the 13 eigenvalues as input values and the ORR and OER overpotentials of the 180 X-TMN4@Gra structures computed via DFT as target values, we constructed an ML model. Initially, the input data stemming from DFT calculations were partitioned into training (80 %) and test (20 %) sets. Five distinct algorithms (GBR, SVR, RFR, XGB, and Ridge) were chosen for predictive modeling. Each algorithm was rigorously tested in a round-robin fashion to identify the optimal combination of RMSE and R2 values, which served as metrics for evaluating algorithmic accuracy. As depicted in Fig. 5 (a–d), the RFR algorithm exhibits the most favorable performance for both training and testing sets, achieving a training R2 score of 0.99 and a testing R2 score of 0.97 for η ORR prediction. Similarly, for OER prediction, the RFR algorithm outperformed the others, achieving a training R2 score of 0.99 and a testing R2 score of 0.96. While the GRB and XGB algorithms also displayed good fitting results, their predictive accuracy was inferior to that of the RFR algorithm. The findings indicate that the trained RFR algorithm is reliable in forecasting catalytic activity, thereby justifying its selection for further predictions of ORR and OER catalytic performance. The accuracy of the Random Forest Regression (RFR) algorithm in predicting catalytic performance is directly influenced by the assignment of feature importance. Fig. 5(e) and (f) illustrates the feature importance obtained through the RFR algorithm for predicting ORR and OER. For statistical convenience, the 13 feature values carrying the largest feature weights were chosen. As evident from Fig. 5(e), the ΔG OOH* (32.27 %), ΔG 4.92-HOO* (22.61 %), ΔG OH* (21.96 %), and ΔG O* (10.14`%) feature values exhibit a significant correlation (contribution >10 %) with the predicted outcomes. Collectively, these four feature values account for 86.98 % of the total weight. Notably, among these features, the descriptors pertaining to ΔG OOH* hold the highest proportion, thereby emerging as the most crucial descriptors for predicting the ORR model. In contrast, the remaining eigenvalues exert a lesser influence on the prediction results. Turning to Fig. 5(f), the data reveals that ΔG O*-OH* (40.62 %), ΔG OOH*-O* (30.01 %) and ΔG O* (20.52 %) are the eigenvalues that demonstrate the strongest correlation (contribution >10 %) with the predicted outcomes. The cumulative percentage linked to ΔG O* amounts to 91.15 %, suggesting that ΔG O*-OH* (40.62 %) or ΔG O* eigenvalues can serve as vital descriptors for anticipating OER performance. The SHAP value can analyze the impact trend of changes in input data on predicted overpotential. In Fig. 5(e) and (f), the change from blue to red on the right vertical axis represents the range of variation in the input data of relevant eigenvalues from small to large. The positive and negative values on the horizontal axis represent whether the predicted overpotential is relatively smaller or larger. And a smaller overpotential is what we expect. As shown in Fig. 5(e), most purple samples fall within the negative range of the X-axis, while red and blue samples are mostly in the positive range of the X-axis, indicating that excessive or insufficient adsorption energy of the OOH* intermediate is not conducive to reducing the overpotential of the catalytic conversion ORR in the system. In the case of the adsorption energy of the OOH* intermediate falls within the purple range (from 3.5 eV to 4.5 eV), can it enhance the ORR performance of the system and lower the overpotential of the catalytic ORR. Unlike OOH*, for OH* and O* intermediates, only excessively low adsorption strength is unfavorable for reducing the overpotential of the ORR reaction. As can be seen from the X-axis range where samples are scattered in Fig. 5(f), excessively large or small ΔG O*-OH* is not conducive to reducing the overpotential of the catalytic conversion OER in the X-TMN4@Gra systems. Only when the adsorption energy of ΔG O*-HO* falls within the purple range (from 1.0 eV to 2.0 eV), can it enhance the OER performance of the X-TMN4@Gra systems and lower the overpotential of the catalytic OER. It is worth mentioning that excessively low adsorption strength of the O* intermediate is also unfavorable for reducing the overpotential of the OER reaction. The results predicted by machine learning are the same as the results of DFT. Therefore, it is unequivocally concluded that the employment of the ML method is profoundly instrumental in elucidating the intrinsic correlation between catalytic activity and the influence of heteroatom doping. 4 Conclusions To sum up, using first-principles calculations, we carried out a computational screening to investigation on the ORR and OER catalytic performance of the heteroatom (B, C, N, O, P, S, etc.) doped TMN4@Gra systems. The S3-CoN4@Gra (η OER = 0.188 V) and P4-CoN4@Gra (η ORR = 0.225 V) possesses the lowest OER and ORR overpotential, respectively. The results found that heteroatoms doped in the first, second or further coordination sphere can affect the adsorption strength of the reaction intermediates by adjusting the d-electronic properties of the TM, thus fine-tuning the catalytic activity and transforming limiting step of the TMN4@Gra systems. The mathematical statistics shown that S and O doping have the optimal regulatory effects on the ORR and OER overpotentials, respectively. And the average limiting potential is lowest when the heteroatom is doped at site 4 and site 5 for ORR and OER, doping sites, doping directions and elements have different effects on ORR and OER activities respectively. The AIMD simulations predict that X-TMN4@Gra systems have high thermodynamic stability at temperatures up to 600 K. Furthermore, a comprehensive machine learning analysis by Random Forest Regression (RFR) model indicate that ΔG OOH* and ΔG O*-OH* can serve as vital descriptors for anticipating ORR and OER performance, respectively. Notably, the application of this machine learning (ML) approach is remarkably beneficial in elucidating the intrinsic relationship between catalytic activity and the impact of heteroatom doping. We firmly believe that this systematic study offers profound insights into the design and discovery of bifunctional single-atom catalysts (SACs).

        "dc:description": "Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with explicit metal-nitrogen-carbon moieties have attracted extensive attention over the past decade. Yet, understanding their catalytic origin toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) remains a great task due to the complicated coordination environment surrounding the active center. Here, we employed large scale density functional theory computations to examine the OER/ORR performance on 144 heteroatom-doped SACs (X-TMN4@Gra, TM=Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Rh, Ir, X = B, N, O, P, S). Computational results unveiled the significant role of heteroatom doping in affecting the local electronic properties of TM centers and their catalytic activity, even leading to the transition of potential limiting steps. Machine learning (ML) enabled to delve deeper into the correlation between atomic characteristics and catalytic activity, suggesting that ΔG OOH* and ΔG O*-OH* can serve as vital descriptors for anticipating ORR and OER performance, respectively. These revelations not only elucidate the catalytic discrepancy of reported SACs but provide a rational way to optimize secondary coordination of SACs, thus paving new opportunities to discover the high-performance electrocatalysts.",
