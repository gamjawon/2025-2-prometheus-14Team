BALCAR, B. MATYSKA and M. SVESTKA J. Heyrovsky Institute of Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry, Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, Mdchova 7, 12138 Prague 2 (Czechoslovakia) (Received April 13,1982; accepted February 17, 1983) Summary Reactions of WC4 with Ph4Sn and its chloro derivatives are accompanied by a considerable increase of the electric conductivity of the solution. Com- parison of the catalytic activity in olefin metathesis with the time depen- dence of the electrical conductivity does not give any evidence for a direct relationship between the ionic species formed during the reaction of the starting components and the catalytically active centres. Introduction There are only sporadic reports in the literature concerning metathesis catalysts occuring in an ionic form. For instance, Marshall and Ridgewell suggested the formation of the ions WCl^ and AlBr3Cr in the catalytically active system WCL,/AlBr3 [1]. Bencze and co-workers investigated several carbonyl complexes of tungsten and molybdenum in combination with Lewis acids which yielded active metathesis catalysts. Their ionic character was proved by conductometry [2]. Doyle described a series of ionic com- plexes of the type R4N+[M(CO)5X]- fairly active in olefin metathesis when combined with alkylaluminium halides or AlBr3 (M = Cr, Mo, W; X = Cl, Br, carboxylate) [3]. It has been suggested also that metathesis catalysts formed in the reaction of WCl^ with EtAlCl; may involve ionic species arising from equilibria of the type [4]: WCL, + Aids T= [WCl^-iF + [AlCLJ- This view is strongly supported by the fact that alkylaluminium halides induce or enhance the activity of various tungsten-based catalysts [5,6]. Recently, a mechanism via metal-stabilized carbonium ion intermediates has been proposed for the rearrangement of cyclopropanes under the action of the system WClg/Pt^Sn [7]. In general, however, ions are not considered to play any role in catalysts formed in reactions of WClg with organometallic compounds. 0304-5102/83/$3.00 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 160 The aim of the present study was to find out whether ionic species are formed in the frequently studied system WCl6/Ph4Sn, and, if so, to elucidate their relationship to the active centres in olefin metathesis. In parallel experi- ments, electrical conductivity, activity in metathesis of hex-1-ene orhept-1- ene and the spectroscopic behaviour of the systems WCl^ + Pl^Sn, Ph3SnCl and Pl^SnC^, respectively, in benzene at 295 K were investigated. Experimental Materials WClfi (Koch-Light, pure) was purified by repeated sublimation in uacuo. Ph4Sn (Pierce Inorg.) was dried by prolonged evacuation and used as such. WClg, Ph3SnCl and Ph2SnCl2 were synthetized and purified according to methods previously described [8, 9]. Benzene (A.R.G. Lachema) was succes- sively shaken with cone. H2SC>4, distilled water, caustic soda and predried over molecular sieve 4A, then fractionated on a 30-TP column and finally refluxed for two days over NaH. Olefins (Fluka, puriss) were refluxed over NaH and fractionated under argon. Solutions of the reaction components in benzene were prepared in uacuo and enclosed in breakable phials. Electrical conductivity Measurements of the electrical conductivity during the reactions of the catalyst components were carried out in an all-glass reactor equipped with a magnetic stirrer and attached to the vacuum or argon manifold. A special conductivity cell, consisting of several concentric platinum cylinders sepa- rated by Teflon insulation [10], was suspended on two molybdenum leads and immersed in the reaction mixture. Changes in the cell resistance were measured by means of a highly sensitive d.c. electrometer circuit. Specific conductivities as low as 1CT16 S cm\"1 could be followed accurately. Dosing of the reaction components was carried out by breaking the phials con- taining the corresponding solution into the reactor pre-evacuated to 10~3 Pa. Benzene was distilled directly from the storage vessel. Finally the whole apparatus was filled with purified argon to atmospheric pressure. Metathesis experiments The catalytic activity of the reaction mixtures of WCl^ with Ph4Sn or with its chloro derivatives was tested in the metathesis of hex-1-ene or hept- 1-ene in benzene at 295 K under argon. The course of the reaction was followed by determining the amount of ethylene liberated during the reac- tion. The dosage of the reaction components was the same as described above. In all experiments extreme care was taken to avoid any contact of the reactants with air. Spectroscopy Reaction mixtures for spectroscopic measurements were prepared in a two-chamber reactor attached to the vacuum line. A side arm bearing a 161 Suprasil cuvette was sealed to one chamber. After evacuation, one chamber was charged with the solution of WClg in benzene and the other with the stannic compound. Thereafter the whole reactor was sealed off and placed into the cuvette compartment of a Varian Cary 17D spectrophotometer. The reaction was started by mixing the solutions from both chambers. Results and discussion The electrical conductivity of the individual reaction components Benzene: The specific conductivity of pure benzene is extremely low and depends critically on the presence of trace impurities which are often not detectable by conventional analytical methods. For this reason also the attainable degree of purity of benzene used throughout this work was a most problem- atic factor. Although the purification procedure was always the same, the specific conductivity of CgH^ varied within 1CT15 to 1CT14 S cm~1. GLC anal- ysis, however, did not show the presence of any unknown compound. Solutions of WCIf,: Specific conductivities of the 10~3 M solutions in benzene (used in most experiments) varied from 5.9 X KT12 to 2.6 X KT11 S cm\"1. However, there was no correlation between the conductivity of benzene and that of the solu- tion of WClfi prepared in the same batch. Most probably, such behaviour may be attributable to the presence of residual water in the benzene as well as to water adsorbed on the walls of the reactor. Its influence on the conductivity of benzene is less significant (due to its low degree of ionization in benzene) than the influence on the conductivity of the solutions of WCl^ where a Bronsted-Lewis acid system is formed. Nevertheless, in spite of the variations of the absolute value of the specific conductivity of different solutions of WClfi, in individual experiments carried out under careful exclusion of any contact with the air and with benzene purified by the procedure described above, the conductivity remained constant for many hours (Fig. 1, curve 1). The effect of the addition of an equimolar amount of water on the conductivity of the solution of WClg is illustrated in the same figure, curve 2. It is seen that immediately after the addition of water the specific conductivity starts to increase for about two hours to a limiting value, and then remains practically unchanged. At this stage, however, all the WClg has been already consumed. Solutions of phenylstannanes: Solutions of Ph4Sn, Pr^SnCI and Pl^SnClz (all 4 X KT3 M) did not show any differences in their conductivities in comparison with that of pure benzene. Addition of hept-1-ene to a solution of WClg resulted in a slight drop of the conductivity which after a given induction period began to rise. Simulta- 162 3456 t.hours Fig. 1. Plots of the specific conductivity (K) versus time for benzene solutions of WClg: (1), pure WC4: ([WClg] = 1 mmol 1~1), hept-1-ene added after 20 h (molar ratio heptene/ WCl6 = 1000); (2), effect of water: ([WCle] = 1 mmol r1), 1 ml of benzene saturated with water added after 2 h (molar ratio HiO/WClg = 1.2). neously a slow alkylation of benzene took place, accompanied by the reduc- tion of WClfi to WClg and the formation of biphenyl. The rates of these reactions were negligible when compared with the reactions of WClg with Ph4Sn or Pl^SnCI or with the rate of metathesis under the same condi- tions. From the facts mentioned above, it follows that the trace impurities present in the systems studied in this work influence the absolute values of the specific conductivities of the initial solutions but do not contribute significantly to the effects observed during the reactions of WClg with phenyl- stannanes. The electrical conductivities of the reaction mixtures Reactions of WClg with Ph4Sn, Pt^SnCI and PhiSnCIa, respectively, are accompanied by a steep increase of approximately 1.5 orders of magnitude in the electrical conductivity of the reaction mixture, which takes place after an induction period (Fig. 2). In the later stages of the reaction the conductivity changes are very small. The sharp increase in the conductivity was also observed when the alkenes under investigation and/or dibutyl ether were present (Figs. 3 and 4). The shapes of the time-conductivity curves remained unaffected when the sequence of the dosing of the reaction components was reversed. The course of the conductivity during the reaction of WClg with tetraphenyltin in the presence of hept-1-ene indicates clearly that at least two kinds of ionic species are formed successively (curve 1 in Fig. 3 and curve 2 in Fig. 4), regardless of the presence or absence of dibutyl ether. Furthermore, hept-1-ene has an accelerating effect on the formation of these ions whereas dibutyl ether has the reverse effect. Ions appear instantaneously when a solution of Pl^SnCI is mixed with that of WClg (Fig. 5). Again, in 163 19 20 21 , hours Fig. 2.

Conductivity measurements provide no possibility of determining the concentrations of the ions present because their structures and mobilities at infinite dilution are not known. For this reason the conductivity curves only qualitatively illustrate the changes in concentration of ionic species during the reactions under study. Nevertheless, they indicate unambiguously that there is a marked difference between the concentration of the ions formed in 164 Fig. 4.

Comparison of the metathesis activity with the formation of ionic species The metathesis of alkenes catalyzed by the system WCle + Ph4Sn at temperatures 50 - 70 C is very fast. The reaction stops within a few minutes at conversions near 60%, even when the equilibrium is continuously disturbed by the removal of ethylene [11]. On the other hand, at 22 C (the tempera- ture used in the conductivity experiments) the reaction rate is very low. An example of the conversion curve in the metathesis of hept-1-ene at 22 C is shown in Fig. 3, curve 2. The reaction conditions in the metathesis experi- ment were the same as those used in the conductivity experiment represented by curve 1 in the same figure. However, in order to get a reasonable reaction rate, the concentrations of all reaction components in metathesis were 165 doubled. A comparison of both curves in Fig. 3 shows that whereas the rate of metathesis remains constant for nearly two hours after the start, indicating a constant concentration of active centres, the concentrations of ions under- go dramatic changes within the same time interval. On the other hand, the next stage of the metathesis reaction is characterized by an increase in the reaction rate and no changes in the concentrations of ions. Finally, at longer reaction times the rate of metathesis declines to zero but the concentrations of ions remain unchanged. Combinations of WClg with Pl^SnCI or Ph^SnClz did not exhibit any metathetical activity under the conditions used in this work. Concentrations of the ions formed in these cases reached virtually the same level as in the highly active WClg-Pl^Sn system. On the basis of these findings it may be concluded that the ionic species remaining in the reaction mixtures of WClg with phenylstannanes as rela- tively stable products are not similar to the active centres generated in metathesis. However, the existing data do not indicate any direct relation- ship between the ions formed in the early stages of the reaction of WClg with Ph4Sn in the presence of the olefin and the active centres involved in the system. Spectroscopic investigation of the reaction mixtures These studies were undertaken with the aim of detecting the formation of ionic species (or more likely the formation of complexes capable of dis- sociation into ions) from the UV-visible spectra of the reaction mixtures over the spectral range 280 - 750 nm. A brief description of these results has been reported already [12], and together with the additional data listed here these may be summarized as follows: (a) The UV-visible spectrum of WCle in benzene (bands at 326, 370, 430 and 540 nm) undergoes an immediate change upon the addition of Ph4Sn, Ph3SnCl or Pl^SnClz, respectively, with all the bands diminishing but not changing their positions. After a time interval, ranging from several minutes for an excess of Ph4Sn to many hours for Ph^SnCI;, distinct new bands appear at ca. 350 and 480 nm which may be assigned to WCls. At the same time a band develops at 390 nm (presumably belonging to PhWCl4 [12]). All these bands successively disappear after prolonged reaction times, with the simultaneous appearance of a further band at 305-315 nm which eventually remains in the spectrum of the reaction mixture for several days (depending on the Sn/W ratio used in the reaction mixture). The fact that the position of the absorption maximum for this band varies over a given spectral range indicates the presence of at least two bands at wavelengths very close to each other. These bands can be assigned to some soluble forms of WC4 since within the same wavelength interval a strong band also appears when WCIs is used as the initial tungsten compound (Fig. 6). Since the final products of the reaction of WC1<, with Ph4Sn, i.e. WCLt and/or PhWC^ [13, 14], are insoluble in benzene, the soluble forms of tungsten(IV) might be complexes of these compounds with phenylchlorostannanes in the absence 166 300 350 WO 450 M\"\"') 500 Fig. 6. Changes in the UV-visible spectra of the reaction mixture WCl5 + Ph^n in benzene with time: [WCIs] = [Ph4Sn] = 1.4 mmol r1, 296 K; reaction time: curve 1, 0 min; curve 2, 15 min; curve 3, 85 min; curve 4, 120 min. of olefin, and/or complexes with olefin when the reduction of WCl^ is carried out in its presence. In this latter case the band at 315 nm is very intense. Detection of free ions which could eventually arise from the dissociation of tungsten(IV) complexes is hardly to be expected, since their absorption may coincide with that of non-dissociated complexes. Thus it is known [15], for example, that the WC1|~ anion of the salt I^WCl^ has an absorption band in Nujol at 314 nm. (b) Neither hept-1-ene nor dibutyl ether have any apparent influence on the number and position of the absorption bands of WCl^. Furthermore, the bands of the intermediate products were not influenced by the presence of the olefin, but in the presence of dibutyl ether the most intense band for WCIs (which occurs at 350 nm) was shifted by ca. 3 nm to higher wave- lengths. The rate of the reduction of WGI(, by Ph4Sn or Pl^SnCI is higher in the presence of hept-1-ene and lower in the presence of dibutyl ether in comparison to that observed in the absence of a third compound. However, second-order reaction kinetics are observed in all cases. (c) All the stannanes examined in this work also reduced WClg (bands in benzene at 295, 348 and 480 nm). Thus the most intense band (at 348 nm) was instantaneously shifted by 3 - 5 nm to higher wavelengths upon the addi- tion of any phenylstannane. However, this may be taken as evidence for the initial mutual interaction of the reactants taking place prior to the regular reduction of WCIs. In order to clarify whether such a shift could provide information regarding the formation of a complex containing the WCl^ anion we have synthesized the compound Pr^AsWClg according to the methods described in the literature [16]. The spectrum of this compound was iden- tical with that of pure WC^ and for this reason it may be concluded that WCIs, whether free or in the form of a complex, always absorbs at ca. 350 nm with small deviations of a few nanometres depending on the type of interaction occurring with other components in the solution. Hence the UV- visible spectra of reaction mixtures of WClg with phenylstannanes cannot provide unambiguous evidence for the formation of ions. The results of the spectroscopic experiments indicate that in the reac- tion mixtures studied neither free nor complexed ions are directly detectable. 167 However, phenomena such as the formation of a stable benzene-soluble form of tungsten(IV) in the absence of added olefin or a distinct and instantaneous interaction of WClg with phenylstannanes may be readily explained by the assumption that lower-valency tungsten chlorides interact with phenyl- chlorostannanes with the formation of weak complexes, for example (Ph3SnCl)2-WCl4 or PhaSnCI,-WC4 in the former case and PhgSnCl-WCIs in the latter. Complexes of this type can partially dissociate into their original components and partially into ions such as PhaSn\"1', PhySn2*, WClg and WClj\". Complexes containing tungsten(V) are unstable and undergo further reduc- tion; for this reason the ions derived from such complexes also are succes- sively transformed into the more stable tungsten(IV) type. The existence of the ions Pl^Sn* and PhaSn2\"^ is well known, as they form salts with many acids [17,18], while the formation of the cation R3Sn+ in the reactions of R4Sn with some iron(III) complexes has been reported recently [19]. Conclusions 1. The reactions of WClg with tetraphenyltin and with its chloro deriva- tives are accompanied by the formation of very low concentrations of ionic species. 2. A comparison of the metathetical activity of the systems mentioned above with the occurrence of ions at different stages during the reaction did not reveal the direct participation of the ions in metathesis. 3. Spectroscopic investigations of the reactions of WClg and WC4 with phenylstannanes did not provide direct evidence for the presence of ions. Some phenomena, however, may be explained by the existence of weak complexes formed between WC4 or WCIs and phenylchlorostannanes which are capable of dissociating into ions. References 1 P. R.

Comparison of the catalytic activity in olefin metathesis with the time dependence of the electrical conductivity does not give any evidence for a direct relationship between the ionic species formed during the reaction of the starting components and the catalytically active centres.",
