In this paper, the density functional theory study was performed to investigate the reaction mechanism of acceptorless dehydrogenation catalyzed by bifunctional catalysts. The calculation results indicate that the catalyst bearing the Co(III) center adopts the inner-sphere stepwise dehydrogenation mechanism. The H2 formation was found to be the rate-determining step, and the proton-shuttle type transition state effectively reduces the activation energy barrier. Furthermore, the catalytic activities of the noble metals (Rh and Ir) were investigated and compared. The results suggest that the noble metals prefer the outer-sphere bifunctional transfer mechanism for the dehydrogenation reaction. Frontier molecular orbital analysis shows that the HOMO-LUMO gap of the active species increases along with the periodic number, which leads to a weakening of the coordination strength of the substrate to the metal center, resulting in the different mechanistic selectivity toward dehydrogenation reaction. In addition, based on the distortion-interaction analysis, the different activation energy barrier in the H2 formation step is illuminated. The reduced ionic radii of the Co result in lower deformation energies of the catalyst and substrate structures in the H2 formation transition state, thus lowering the activation energy barrier. Our results reveal the advantages of base metal in dehydrogenation reactions, which is expected to provide theoretical guidance for future catalyst design.

Introduction With the gradual depletion of fossil energy sources, the search for renewable and clean energy is urgent [1]. As a representative of clean and sustainable alternatives, hydrogen energy has received great attention worldwide [2]. However, hydrogen storage has always been the bottleneck in the utilization of hydrogen energy [3]. Unlike physical hydrogen storage, chemical hydrogen storage employs the catalytic hydrogenation reaction to convert hydrogen energy into covalent bonds of liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) such as alcohols and formic acid, which is environmentally friendly and convenient to store and transport [4–6]. LOHCs can release hydrogen with the aid of acceptorless dehydrogenation catalysts [7]. Therefore, the design and preparation of relevant acceptorless dehydrogenation catalysts are of great importance to achieving efficient use of hydrogen energy [8]. Conventional homogeneous catalysts for the acceptorless dehydrogenation reaction are based mainly on noble metals and phosphine ligands [9–11]. The Ru-PNN (PNN designates (2-(di‑tert-butylphosphinomethyl)−6-diethylaminomethyl) pyridine) catalyst (Fig. 1 . Cat. 1) developed by Milstein et al. represents a successful example. This complex can catalyze the dehydrogenative coupling reaction of alcohols at 157 °C. The aromatization/dearomatization mechanism is proposed for the activation of the OH bond, and the dehydrogenation reaction proceeds via the inner-sphere β-hydride elimination of the dissociation of hemiliable N-arm of the pincer ligand [12]. Sun et al. reported the Ru complex [RuCl2(fac-PNN)(PPh3)] (Fig. 1. Cat. 2) (PNN designates N-(2-(diphenylphosphino)ethyl)−5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinolin-8-amine), which is effective for the acceptorless dehydrogenation of aromatic and aliphatic secondary alcohols [13]. Utilizing EI-MS and NMR spectroscopy, the catalytic mechanism is verified and the NH functional ligand is involved in the dehydrogenation reaction. In 2017, Yamaguchi et al. successfully synthesized an excellent example of an Ir catalyst (Fig. 1. Cat. 3) based on N-Heterocyclic carbene and an α‑hydroxyl-pyridine ligand, which shows good water solubility and can efficiently catalyze the dehydrogenation coupling reaction without the base [14]. The hydroxyl group functions as the ancillary ligand in the dehydrogenation reaction. Due to noble metal's unavoidable problems, such as high cost, high toxicity and low storage capacity, the development of transition metal catalysts based on base metals is of great importance [15–17]. Especially for cobalt, the changeable oxidation and spin states allows for the results in various catalytic mechanism [18–20]. In 2013, Hanson et al. synthesized a Co(II) pincer complex [Co(CH2SiMe3)(Cy2PCH2N(H)CH2CH2PCy2)]BArF4, which transforms into Co(III) complex (Fig. 1. Cat. 4) as resting state under experimental condition [21]. The Co(III) complex can catalyze the acceptorless dehydrogenation reaction of secondary alcohols via Co(I/III) redox mechanism. In 2018, Ding et al. developed a tetradentate tripodal Co(II) complex(Fig. 1. Cat. 5), which can function as precatalysts for the efficient acceptorless dehydrogenation of secondary alcohols to afford ketones [22]. Recently, Tang et al. successfully synthesized a half-sandwich complex utilizing Co(III) as the metal center, which can efficiently catalyze the acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohol [23]. Experimental mechanistic studies have shown that the NH functional group on the pyrazole ligand facilitates the dehydrogenation reaction via metal-ligand cooperation (Fig. 2 ) [24–28]. The excellent catalytic activity of this system and the unique ligand structure of the catalyst have attracted our research interest. Nevertheless, the mechanistic details are not clear due to the variable coordination modes of the first-row transition metal catalyst [29,30]. Whether the MLC process occurs in the first or second coordination sphere? What are the advantages of cobalt center over conventional noble metal centers in the same group? Herein, a density functional theory study was carried out to investigate the reaction mechanism of this catalytic system. The catalytic activities of the Rh and Ir catalysts based on the same ligand were investigated to clarify the mechanistic differences between noble and base metals. We anticipate these results to be valuable for future catalyst design. Computational details The density functional theory calculations were performed by the Gaussian 09 software [31]. The geometry optimization was carried out at the M06-L [32]/def2-SVP [33] level of theory. Different functionals were evaluated and compared, and the calculated activation free energy results are consistent (Please see Table S1). The solvent effect of toluene was considered using the SMD model at M06-L/def2-TZVP level of theory [34]. The free energy change of 1 mol of an ideal gas from 1 atm (24.46 L/mol, standard state 0) to 1 M (1 mol/L, standard state) was added to all the species [35]. All stationary points and transition states were confirmed and verified by vibration analysis and the Intrinsic Reaction Coordinates (IRC) calculations. The geometries of the key intermediates and transition states were generated using CYLview software [36]. The molecular orbitals were depicted by IQmol Software [37]. Results and discussion The activation of pre-catalyst The activation of Pre_cat is shown in Fig. 3 . Two activation pathways were proposed. The results show that the activation free energy barrier of the formation of HI via Pre-TS1 is 34.8 kcal/mol. Alternatively, the coordination of tBuO− was found to be a downhill process (ΔG = −30.2 kcal/mol). The deprotonation via Pre-TS2 requires an activation free energy of only 13.3 kcal/mol and forms Pre-IM2. The release of tBuOH generates Co-0 and provides a vacant coordination site at the cobalt center, which can initiate the catalytic cycle of acceptorless dehydrogenation reaction. The mechanistic preference of acceptorless alcohol dehydrogenation The dehydrogenation reaction starts with the coordination of BnOH in Co-0 to form Co-1(Fig. 4 ), which is found to be a downhill process (ΔG = −6.1 kcal/mol). Both outer-sphere bifunctional hydrogen transfer mechanism and inner-sphere stepwise transfer were considered. The bifunctional hydrogen transfer via Co-TS4 is located in a concerted manner with the activation free energy of 21.4 kcal/mol (Co-1→Co-TS4). As for the inner-sphere mechanism, the cleavage of the OH bond occurs via either Co-TS1 in a five-membered ring mode or Co-TS1-PS in a seven-membered ring mode with an extra molecular of BnOH. The calculated results suggest the proton-shuttle type transition state Co-TS1-PS (ΔG≠ = 1.7 kcal/mol) significantly lower the activation free energy barrier, which is more favourable than Co-TS1 (ΔG≠ = 16.3 kcal/mol). The generated alkoxide complex Co-2 is found to be a thermodynamic sink in the potential energy surface. The following β-hydride elimination takes place via Co-TS2 with the dissociation of ligand pyridine. The activation free energy of Co-TS2 is 20.4 kcal/mol. Subsequently, the generated Co hydride complex Co-3 forms the H2 molecular via the assistance of the NH functional group via either Co-TS3 or Co-TS3-PS. Similarly, the proton-shuttle type transition state Co-TS3-PS is found to be more plausible than Co-TS3. An alternative H2 generation pathway without the NH functional group assistance via Co-TS5 is considered as well, in which a molecular of BnOH coordinates to the Co center and transfers the proton to generate the alkoxide complex Co-2 via Co-TS5. However, this reaction pathway is found to be much higher than Co-TS3-PS in the free energy surface, which can be ruled out. Based on the calculated results, the H2 formation process is the rate-determining step of the catalytic cycle. Therefore, the distortion-interaction analysis [38] is performed to illuminate the origin of the mechanistic preference toward Co-TS3-PS instead of Co-TS5 (Fig. 5 ). According to the calculated results, the distortion energy of both catalysts is similar (Co-TS3-PS: 109.6 kcal/mol, Co-TS5: 111.2 kcal/mol). Nevertheless, the interaction energy of Co-TS3-PS (100.1 kcal/mol) is much stronger compared with Co-TS5 (82.4 kcal/mol) as both the Co center and the NH functional group participate in the bond breaking and formation process. The comparison between base metal (Co) and noble metal (Rh and ir) With the understanding of the catalytic mechanistic preference in acceptorless dehydrogenation, the comparison of noble metal with the base metal is investigated with DFT calculation based on the same ligand and the calculated results are depicted in Fig. 6 . The activation free energy barrier of outer-sphere bifunctional hydrogen transfer mechanism for Rh and Ir center catalyst are 20.4 kcal/mol (Rh-1→Rh-TS4) and 17.7 kcal/mol (Ir-0→Ir-TS4), respectively. As for the inner-sphere dehydrogenation mechanism, the activation free energy results are 21.7 kcal/mol (Rh-1→Rh-TS2) and 24.6 kcal/mol (Ir-0→Ir-TS2) for Rh and Ir, respectively. Therefore, both Rh and Ir choose to proceed the out-sphere bifunctional dehydrogenation mechanism. A clear difference in the coordination process of BnOH between base and noble metal is observed. The BnOH coordination for Co is an exothermic reaction (Co-0→Co-1: ΔG = −6.1 kcal/mol). The BnOH coordination for Rh is still an exothermic reaction though less favourable than Co center (Rh-0→Rh-1: ΔG = −3.5 kcal/mol). However, the coordination of BnOH for Ir exhibits an endothermic reaction (Ir-0→Ir-1: ΔG = 3.8 kcal/mol). Notably, the free energy barrier results for the β-hydride elimination are 20.4 kcal/mol (Co-2→Co-TS2), 20.6 kcal/mol (Rh-2→Rh-TS2) and 20.7 kcal/mol (Ir-2→Ir-TS2) for Co, Rh and Ir, respectively, which are similar for both base metal and noble metal. Therefore, the different reaction free energy in the BnOH coordination leads to an opposite mechanistic selectivity in the dehydrogenation of BnOH between noble and base metals. To shed light on the origin of such difference, the optimized structure of the BnOH coordinated complex and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the starting point (Co-0, Rh-0 and Ir-0) is analyzed (Fig. 7 ). The HOMO-LUMO energy gap of Co-0, Rh-0 and Ir-0 are 1.23 eV, 1.57 eV and 1.94 eV, respectively. The Co-0 possesses the smallest HOMO-LUMO energy gap and leads to the best activity for BnOH coordination reaction compared with Rh and Ir. Moreover, the bond length of M-O in the BnOH coordinated complex follows the same trend (2.08 Å, 2.32 Å and 2.38 Å). The natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis was further performed on the BnOH coordinated complex for all the three catalysts (Co-1, Rh-1 and Ir-1). The second-order stabilizing interaction energy from lone pair of oxygen atom in hydroxyl group to empty antibonding orbital of metal center (LPO→LP*M) is 66.55 kcal/mol, 23.96 kcal/mol and 11.92 kcal/mol for Co, Rh and Ir, respectively. This suggests that the strong stabilizing effect of the BnOH ligand coordination in Co-1 is responsible for the exothermic process associated with the formation of Co-1. Besides, it is found that the bond length of the OH bond of Co-1, Rh-1 and Ir-1 is 0.974 Å, 0.973 Å and 0.971 Å, respectively, which suggests the back-donation from the Ir d orbital to OH anti-bonding orbital is weakest compared with Rh and Co. Though the LUMO energy level of Ir is slightly higher than that of Rh, the HOMO energy level of Ir is lower compared with Rh as well, which implies the Ir is less active both as electron donor and acceptor during the BnOH coordination process. Therefore, the coordination of BnOH to Ir-0 is found to be an endothermic reaction. The formation of H2 remains the rate-determining step for Rh and Ir catalysts. The calculated results indicate the activation free energy barrier is 21.4 kcal/mol (Co-2→Co-TS3-PS), 22.9 kcal/mol (Rh-3→Rh-TS3-PS) and 24.7 kcal/mol (Ir-3→Ir-TS3-PS) for Co, Rh and Ir, respectively, which suggests the base metal exhibited better catalytic activity than noble metals. This reuslt is consistent with the conclusion addressed in previous theoretical studies by Jaccob et al., which suggests that Co(III) exhibits better catalytic activity in formic acid dehydrogenation reactions [39–41]. Therefore, the distortion-interaction analysis is performed to shed light on the origin of the different activities (Fig. 8 ). The results show that although the noble metal centers Rh and Ir provide stronger interaction energies compared with Co center (Co: ΔEint = −100.1 kcal/mol; Rh: ΔEint = −104.7 kcal/mol; Ir: ΔEint = −114.0 kcal/mol), the distortion energies of catalyst and substrate have increased as well (Co: ΔEdist-sub + ΔEdist-cat = 109.6 kcal/mol; Rh: ΔEdist-sub + ΔEdist-cat = 116.4 kcal/mol; Ir: ΔEdist-sub + ΔEdist-cat = 127.3 kcal/mol) when forming metal-ligand cooperation transition states, leading to a sequential increase in their transition state activation energy barriers both in electronic energy and free energy. From base metal to noble metal, the ionic radius of the metal center increases sequentially. As the distance between the ligand and the metal center increases, a greater deformation of both the alcohol and the pyrazole NH functional group occurs when the H2 transition state is formed. The M-H bond in the transition state is 1.58 Å, 1.71 Å and 1.73 Å for Co, Rh and Ir, respectively. The OH bond in the transition state is 1.22 Å, 1.25 Å and 1.30 Å for Co, Rh and Ir, respectively. Therefore, the larger distortion of both the metal hydride complex and the assisted alcohol for the proton-shuttle transition state results in higher activation energy barriers. Conclusion In summary, a computational study of the acceptorless dehydrogenation catalyzed by phosphine-free bifunctional catalysts was carried out. The calculation results indicate that the catalyst adopts the inner-sphere stepwise mechanism in the alcohol dehydrogenation reaction and the proton-shuttle type effectively reduces the activation energy barrier in the H2 formation. Moreover, the catalytic activities of the Rh and Ir catalysts based on the same ligand were further investigated. The results suggest that the noble metals exhibit a mechanistic selectivity opposite to that of the Co center in the alcohol dehydrogenation process. The outer-sphere bifunctional concerted mechanism is preferred for noble metal centers. The activation energy barrier of the H2 formation for Rh and Ir catalysts is higher than the Co catalyst. Frontier molecular orbital and distortion-interaction analysis imply that the differences in the electronic structure and ionic radii of noble metals are responsible for their special mechanistic selectivity and high activation energy barriers. These findings are expected to provide a theoretical reference for the design of efficient and inexpensive acceptorless dehydrogenation catalysts in the future.

        "dc:description": "In this paper, the density functional theory study was performed to investigate the reaction mechanism of acceptorless dehydrogenation catalyzed by bifunctional catalysts. The calculation results indicate that the catalyst bearing the Co(III) center adopts the inner-sphere stepwise dehydrogenation mechanism. The H2 formation was found to be the rate-determining step, and the proton-shuttle type transition state effectively reduces the activation energy barrier. Furthermore, the catalytic activities of the noble metals (Rh and Ir) were investigated and compared. The results suggest that the noble metals prefer the outer-sphere bifunctional transfer mechanism for the dehydrogenation reaction. Frontier molecular orbital analysis shows that the HOMO-LUMO gap of the active species increases along with the periodic number, which leads to a weakening of the coordination strength of the substrate to the metal center, resulting in the different mechanistic selectivity toward dehydrogenation reaction. In addition, based on the distortion-interaction analysis, the different activation energy barrier in the H2 formation step is illuminated. The reduced ionic radii of the Co result in lower deformation energies of the catalyst and substrate structures in the H2 formation transition state, thus lowering the activation energy barrier. Our results reveal the advantages of base metal in dehydrogenation reactions, which is expected to provide theoretical guidance for future catalyst design.",
