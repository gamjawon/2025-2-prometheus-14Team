ELSEVIER Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 45~55 APPLIED CATALYSIS A: GENERAL Mode of arrangement of components in mixed vanadia catalyst and its bearing for oxidation catalysis P. Courtine*, E. Bordes Ddpartement de Ggnie Chimique, Universiti de Technologie de Compi~gne, BP 529, 60205 Compikgne Cedex, France Abstract Vanadium oxide or V-containing systems are extensively used as components of various catalysts used in mild oxidation, ammoxidation and dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons and other organic compounds. The discussed examples are the definite phases (V-P-O, butene and butane oxidations), supported bulk and monolayers (V-Ti-O, o-xylene oxidation), and mixed oxides (V-Mo-Nb--O, ethane oxidation). The common structural features are commented. Heteropolya- cids, which can be stabilized either on structurally related heteropolysalts or on silica doped with potassium, are also considered as they contain similar molecular sites. The model of coherent interfaces, proposed to explain the synergic effects exhibited by most of these catalysts, is discussed and compared with concepts of other authors. Keywords: Vanadia; Oxidation catalysis I. Introduction The catalytic properties of vanadium oxide in mild oxidation of hydrocarbons are known since 1960s. The first reactions to be performed industrially were o- xylene oxidation to phthalic anhydride and benzene oxidation to maleic anhydride [ 1-6]. Although V205 was found to be active in several reactions of mild oxidation, soon it has been recognized that the addition of other elements was a good means to improve its properties. According to their amount in the V2Os-MxOy system, these elements can be considered as promoters (e.g. V2Os-Pd in oxidation of ethylene to acetaldehyde) [7], or as supports (e.g. V2Os-TiO2 in o-xylene oxidation to phthalic * Corresponding author. 0926-860X/97/$17.00 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

In other cases, definite phases like, e.g. vanadyl pyrophosphate (M---P) or magnesium vanadate (M=Mg), are formed, which show distinct properties in n-butane to maleic anhydride and propane to propene reactions, respectively. In few cases mixed oxides are found, as in the system V2Os-MoO3-Nb205 active in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane [8], and microdomains are expected to account for their special properties [9,10]. Rather than to give an exhaustive list of these modified V205 catalysts which have been extensively studied or are described in the present issue, we have chosen to emphasize the role of coherent interfaces which is important from both fundamental and applied points of view. Therefore we shall consider some typical and distinct examples of catalysts in which the driving forces governing the activity and selectivity have to be discussed in terms of interfacial properties [11,12]: 1. The P/V=I: 1 phases of the [V2Os-P2Os] system in the oxidation of butenes and n-butane to maleic anhydride. A large number of papers have been devoted to this subject [13-21]. We shall restrict ourselves to some of the structural properties of (VO)2P207 when it is alone during the oxidation of n-butane and when it is found beside VOPO4 in the oxidation of butenes. 2. The properties of V205 when supported as \"bulk\" or as monolayer on TiO2. Three polymorphic forms of TiO2, anatase, rutile and TiO2(B), have been used as supports in several oxidation reactions: o-xylene to phthalic anhydride [1-4,22-34], butene and butadiene to maleic anhydride [35,36], butene to acetic acid [37], toluene to benzoic acid [38], methanol and ethanol to aldehydes [39-41] and others [44,45], and also in ammoxidation of alkyl aromatics [42,43]. The kinetics and mechanism of these reactions are known because olefins and aromatics are very reactive as compared to alkanes, and the structural and surface properties of the corresponding catalysts have been examined by numerous techniques. 3. The VzO5 mixed oxides containing other ReO3-1ike oxides such as MoO3 and Nb205. Examples are chosen in the oxidative dehydrogenation and oxidation of ethane [8-10,46-51]. 4. Finally, a very different example of vanadium containing catalyst is given by the polyoxovanadomolybdates. Polyoxomolybdates are used extensively for their acid and redox properties [52-60]. Adding vanadium to H3PMo12040 leads to HaPVMo11040 which is then more active and selective in the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutyric acid to methacrylic acid. Supports were recently proposed to stabilize these Keggin structures which are not thermally stable on stream [60-64]. Although the molecular structure of polyoxometallates is very different at first sight from the above considered polymeric vanadia structures, interfaces between support and active phase can be analyzed in similar ways. P. Courtine, E. Bordes/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 45~55 47 2. The (VO)2P207/VOP04 system In 1987, Sleight et al. [65] noticed that it could be very interesting to know why (VO)2P207, one of the P/V=I : 1 phases of the system, is always present beside VOPO4 in the active catalyst for oxidation of butenes [14,65] while alone it is so selective in the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride [16-20]. In the latter case, XRD patterns of fresh catalysts exhibit only (VO)2P207 lines. However, several studies have shown that the average oxidation state of vanadium in the most active and selective catalyst is slightly above 4.00, which means that some V5+ (formal valence state) are present. The presence of V4+-O bonds has been thought necessary to break the C-H bond and activate the alkane, while V4+ (Lewis acid sites) would activate dioxygen [21]. Indeed, the available electron in the V4+ (dL) orbital could allow the formation of the chemisorption bond since, contrary to the case of olefins or aromatics, there is no 7r-electron in n-butane which could play this role [12]. Oxygen linked to V5+ would then ensure the oxygenation of the intermediate, leading to maleic anhydride. An important question is to know where these V5+ species are located. One way to answer consists in considering the formal valence states of vanadium in (VO)2P207 because in each pair of edge- sharing octahedra the length of the vanadyl V=O bond is different: 1.73 and 1.55 A (mean values) correspond to V4+ and V5+, respectively, as found in other V5+ (e.g. VOPO4) and V4+ (e.g. VOSO4) related phases [12,19,65]. Before considering other interpretations, it is necessary to recall that a special preparation is used to obtain selective (VO)2P207 for n-butane oxidation. Owing to the topotactic nature of the dehydration of the layered precursor VOHPO4.0.5H20, pseudomorphic crystals of (VO)2P207 exhibit mostly (1 0 0) faces [67-69]. It has been shown that the control of the operating parameters during the preparation of the precursor (which affect its crystal morphology) leads to the control of the crystal morphology of the catalyst [70]. However, the operating parameters during calcination and activation are very determinant for the catalytic properties at steady state and for ageing of the catalyst. Depending on these conditions, different shapes, relative intensities and FWHM (Full Width at Height Medium) of XRD lines were observed, which account for strains and crystallite size effects. Two groups of researchers have recently addressed this point. Ebner and Thompson [71 ] synthesized two kinds of (VO)2P207 single crystals, one emerald-green and one red-brown with very close cell parameters (Table 1), but exhibiting some differ- ences in their Raman spectra. Let us recall that, using infrared spectroscopy, we had already observed significant differences between samples of (VO)2P207 obtained by reduction of /3-VOPO4 and by dehydration of VOHPO4.0.5H20 [67]. Their reactivity was also different since, by reoxidation,/3-VOPO4 and 7- VOPO4 were obtained, respectively [72]. The structural differences apparent in the green and red crystals were thought to be likely those which had been identified in microcrystalline catalysts, and thus to relate to the ordering of the metal atoms within the structure [71 ]. Polytypes (or statistically disordered structures) differing 48 P. Courtine, E.

CFour non-equivalent V. by chain symmetry (vanadyl columns) and asymmetric orientation of pyropho- sphate groups around vanadium dimers within the crystal were proposed. This reasoning allowed the authors to propose an explanation of the stabilization of V4+ by excess phosphorus on surface, through the concept of site isolation [73]. The structure of (VO)EP207 has been refined very recently by Nguyen et al. [74], who also found two kinds of colored crystals by varying the oxygen fugacity during synthesis. By titration it was seen that the average oxidation state of V was 4.00 for green crystals and 4.01 for red-brown crystals, so that the green ones were supposed relatively free of both point and extended defects. In the red ones, the observed extensive broadening of XRD (hkl) lines where h and l are odd has been attributed to extended defects, which can be modelled as stacking faults perpendicular to the a and c axes of the cell, as shown also by streaks. We had already observed streaks in the electron microdiffraction patterns of (VO)2P207 in catalysts for oxidation of 1-butene as well as in samples obtained by reduction of ai or /3-VOPO4 [14]. According to the authors [74], the proposed defects could explain the presence of some V5+ ions in (VO)2P2OT. The NMR studies also confirmed that the V5+ present is associated with (VO)2P207 in the form of a solid solution (V4_+2xV~O)2 (P207)l_x (PO4)2x at the bc stacking fault, rather than to a second phase. These bc stacking faults can be described as a change in orientation of the vanadyl distortion resulting in a switch from -V=O-V=O-V= chains to =V-O=V-O=V- chains at the stacking fault boundary, whereas at the ab fault boundary there is no alteration of the double vanadyl chains, but just a change in the XRD pattern of the pyrophosphate groups. These models explain quite well how this unique phase, (VO)2P207, can be a very good catalyst by itself for n-butane oxidation, since it accommodates, as supposed previously [14], both V4+ and V5+ without change of the coordination polyhedra. In this case, there is no need to add another element, nor to invoke the existence of interfaces between an oxidized and a reduced phase, although this was proposed in a former work [18,20]. The situation is different in the case of butene which is much more reactive than n-butane, so that the catalyst has neither to be prepared by a particular way, nor to contain a maximum amount of hard acid P. Courtine, E. Bordes/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 45-65 49 cations such as vanadyl (VO)2+. The active phase is the VS+-containing phase, VOPO4, which ensures the activation of butene by formation of the 7r-allylic complex on V5+ (3d sites. The formation of (VO)2P207 is only the result of the reduction of VOPO4 by butene [14,63,67]. Gravimetric experiments showed indeed that in catalytic conditions (1% butene in air at 450C) the mean stoichiometry of the catalyst at the steady state is VPO4.7. Therefore, the optimal catalyst works as a biphasic system containing microdomains of the oxidized phase, o~- or/~-VOPO4, and of the reduced one, (VO)2P207, according to the Mars and van Krevelen mechanism [66,76]. This mechanism must proceed on neigh- boring sites situated at the boundaries between microdomains of VOPO4 and (VO)2P207. The severe activation barrier between two solid phases is lowered only if the interface is coherent, which means that the surface energies are low enough to allow the transfer of electrons and other species (H, O, etc.) through the interface. Owing to the structural analogies between the lattice planes of the two phases, coherent interfaces between them were indeed thought to be built, until the steady state was reached [11,76]. It must be noticed that on (VO)2P207 itself the CMAS model [21] shows that butene would be adsorbed by its C=C bond on under- saturated oxygens, yielding non-selective by-products. 3. The V2Os/TiO2 system The extent of work on this subject is very large and has been reviewed in several papers [1-4]. We shall recall here the main results obtained on bulk and monolayer supported vanadium oxide catalysts, in order to discuss the validity of the model of coherent interfaces. Because this model has been either partially used or poorly understood, we take the opportunity to come back on it and on the subsequent experiments made to improve it. 3.1. Supported bulk catalysts More than 20 years ago, it has been found that TiO2 (anatase) used as a support for V205 catalyst was responsible for increasing its activity and selectivity in the oxidation of o-xylene to phthalic anhydride [1-4]. At this time, no monolayer catalyst was used. The model of coherent interfaces has been drawn to account for this synergic effect [11,77]. This model is essentially based on the a priori observation that the structures of V205 and TiO2 (anatase) are closely related. Using the concept of coherent interfaces already known to apply in other fields (e.g., semiconductors), and in solid state chemistry [78], it is proposed that the low crystallographic misfit between cleavage planes of V205 and TiO2 (anatase) would be responsible for the lowering of surface energy allowing various species to cross the interface. Therefore, a low misfit (few percents) is to be considered as a pre- requisite condition to observe synergy. Whatever the actual interface is, the atoms 50 P. Courtine, E. Bordes/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 4545 on boundaries are strained, so that their activity is greater than when they are inside the phases. Indeed, in numerous cases of synergic effect, the activity is increased and reaches a maximum at a given composition, while the selectivity is only slightly affected. Another important point is that synergy is observed also in non- catalytic reactions, so that any direct influence of the organic phase is ruled out. In 1970s, Cole et al. [23] and V6jux et al. [77] observed that V205 could be reduced when supported on TiO2 in conditions (N2, 600) which normally do not allow reduction to proceed. Simultaneously, anatase was transformed into rutile with a very low activation energy (15 instead of 150kcal mo1-1) [79]. It has been assumed that the cleavage plane (0 1 0) of V205 is anchored on the (0 0 1), (1 0 0) and (0 1 1) planes of anatase with a very small crystallographic misfit, while similar anchoring would be less easy with rutile because of higher misfit and different pattern. To demonstrate the validity of the concept, other phases structurally related, and between which the calculated misfit is a priori low, were used as supports. Other oxides and oxysalts were as well deposited on Tit2 anatase. Indeed, the reactivity of V205 supported on A1NbO4, GaNbO4 and ZiNb207 and on TiO2(B) was found to be modified, the extent of reduction depending on the support used. For example, in isothermal conditions and in nitrogen, the reduction of V205 supported on TiO2(B) proceeds faster than when VEt5 is supported on anatase (Fig. 1). Moreover, TiOE(B) is transformed partly into anatase at 525 and totally into rutile (through anatase) at 600 after 20 h [80]. When TiO2 anatase was used as a support for other oxides like MoO3 or oxysalts like, e.g. CoMoO4, the partial conversion of TiO2 anatase to rutile was observed [81]. The behavior of V205 supported on titania structurally related phases is also modified in catalytic conditions [33,82]. During the oxidation of o-xylene, Tit2 remains as anatase since the temperature is less than 450. But because of the reducing atmosphere and during the transient state, the successive suboxides of V205 (the cleavage plane patterns of which are similar to V205) are formed by crystallographic shear (CS) plane mechanism. The reduction stops near the V6013 stoichiometry [24,25], the formation of which corresponds to an optimal value of the crystallographic misfit between V205 and TiO2 anatase, and then the steady state is reached because of an optimal strain factor. As solid-solid reactions begin always near the interface common to both solids, we have suggested [34] that the surface free energy Gstrain of the interfacial system could be written as Gstrain :--- 60 + 0-1~2S, (1) where Go is the surface free energy of the crystal alone, o-1_2 the strain factor of the crystal in contact and S the surface of contact. Strain coming from the surface adaptation of the two lattices results in maintaining them in an excited state, the relaxation of which corresponds first to the formation of dislocations, then to the reduction of V205 and to the transformation of TiO2(B) into anatase, and then into rutile [34].

After 20 h, XRD showed 80% and 60% of anatase at 525 and 560, and 100% rutile at 600. No line was seen for vanadium suboxides. V205, we have used Hooke's law to evaluate the variation of elastic interfacial energy from one phase (catalyst) to the other (support). Approximations were made: low values of the crystallographic misfit were assumed to lead to weak deformation of the two lattices, the crystallographic directions used were supposed to be independent and to have the same elasticity constants. Using the cell parameters of YiOz(A) and YiOz(B) supports, and those of V205 and its two suboxides, V6013 and VO2(B) (Table 2), the crystallographic misfits CeI and ot2 were evaluated along the two directions of each lattice plane in contact (Table 3). For example, in the case of (001)V205 and (003)TiO2(A), where a(VzOs)~3a(TiOz(A)), and c(VzOs)~bTiO2(A), we have respectively O!1 = 100aVzO53aTiO2 - A = 1.5%, (2) aV205 ~2 = 100 cV2OsbTiO2 - A = 5.8%.

These results lead to the conclusion that the value of the energy term is favorable to the reduction of V205 into V6013 with anatase support, and to VO2(B) with TiO2(B), in agreement with XRD and microgravimetric experiments. When V205 was supported on A1NbO4, the selectivity in the oxidation of o- xylene to phthalic anhydride was, as expected because of the strong structural relationship with TiO2(B), enhanced in a similar way than with TiO2 (anatase) [83]. When TiO2(B), which is isostructural with VO2(B), was used, we found that the catalyst performance was almost the same than for anatase [34]. The ratio ~ of the area A(hkl) of the \"good\" (hkl) surface plane to the total area ~A of the other exposed planes, taking into account the habit and the mean size of the crystallites, was taken as a means to evaluate the synergy: for TiO2 (B) A(010) ..~ for TiO2(anatase) /2 = ~ ~ 3.5.

XRD pattern (Cu K~) of CVD samples of V205 (8%) supported on SiC, TiO2 rutile and anatase (after [84]). Including the density (3.89 g cm-3 for anatase and 3.25 g cm-3 for TiO2(B)), the value of the ratio #, J2(anatase) 3.89 # = (B) 3.25 = 1.90, showed that finally anatase support could lead to slightly more efficient V2Os catalysts than TiO2(B) support. Since we already suspected that the usual methods of catalyst preparation of this system were not optimized so as to form coherent interfaces between V205 and TiO2, we made some experiments by Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) [84]. V205 (8 wt%) was deposited on SiC, TiO2 (ruffle) and TiO2 (anatase) and then analyzed by XRD. All XRD reflections due to V205 were observed with SiC or TiO2 futile supports, but, when V205 was deposited on TiO2 anatase, a single reflection was observed at 4.28 .~ corresponding to (0 0 1)V205 (Fig. 2). This means that a preferred orientation of V205 is observed only when it is supported on anatase, with (0 0 1)V2Os parallel to (0 0 1)TiOa(A) and (0 0 1)V205 parallel to (1 0 1)TiOa(A). To our opinion, these experiments demonstrate the coherence of interfaces between TiO2 (anatase) and V205. 3.2. Supported monolayered catalysts Soon after the use of supported bulk catalyst, Hanke et al. [85] noticed that better conditions to study the role of transition metal ions as active centers would be met with making of monomolecular layer. Using a grafting method, Bond et al. first 54 P. Courtine, E. Bordes/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 45-65 demonstrated that the yield of phthalic anhydride obtained with a monolayer of vanadium oxide was higher than with bulk V205 (7.7 wt%) supported on TiO2 anatase [26]. Since then, a large number of work has been devoted to this kind of catalyst, all of which cannot be detailed in the present paper. Let us emphasize some points: (i) The improvement of the catalytic performance was thought to be due to the modification of the redox and acid-base properties of this monolayer: as compared to crystalline vanadia [30], much lower acidity is exhibited by the monolayer and this would be responsible for the enhancement of dehydrogenating properties [2,22]. On the contrary, if the support is TiO2 rutile (which is not structurally related to V2Os-type oxide), no modification of these properties was observed. Moreover, crystalline vanadia is able to wet and/or to spread on the surface of TiO2 anatase, whereas such a phenomenon, although not thoroughly explained, is not observed with rutile [32,33]. These two kinds of results show indirectly the strong influence of the structure and morphology of the support on which vanadia is deposited. (ii) Centi et al. [86] studied carefully the catalytic and non-catalytic reactivity of catalysts prepared simply by grinding the two components V205 and TiO2 anatase and rutile, and calcining them in various conditions. Again, they showed that the behavior of vanadium oxide was different according to the form of TiO2. The thermal spreading supposed to proceed in such a kind of preparation was analyzed by Haber [87] and Kn6zinger et al. [88]. The spreading of a solid on the surface of another solid is considered as a \"surface diffusion of constituents of the lattice of the mobile solid in a concentration gradient\", and then requires mobility of the constituents of its lattice. The following definitions and factors governing these surface phenomena, which depend on the so-called interface-free energy gas given by Eq. (2), were proposed [88] ~as = \"~ag ~t_ ~sg -- (Uint - Ustrain)- (4) Tag and %g are the specific surface free energies between the active phase and gas phase, and between support and gas phase, respectively. Uint is the interaction energy, called adhesion energy, between the two oxides per unit area, containing also contributions from \"chemical\" interactions at the interface (for example, when formation of polyvanadates occur). Ustrain is an energy term coming from a possible mismatch of the lattice parameters, similar with Gstrain of Eq. (1) that we proposed for bulk supported catalysts. Since surface free energies will also vary with the nature and composition of the gas phase, but in an unknown form, the tabulated values found in literature can only be used for order-of-magnitude considerations. The Tammann temperature (Twam~0.5 Tmelt' bulk=449 K for VzOs) is considered to be sufficiently low to make atoms or ions of the bulk of a solid sufficiently mobile for bulk-to-surface migrations, the enhanced mobility being associated with two-dimensional melting of the surface of a solid particle, i.e. with the occurrence of a \"liquid-like\" P Courtine, E. Bordes/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 45~5 55 behavior of the surface layer (88). Spreading of V205 may thus be described as migration of species from a \"liquid-like\" surface layer of vanadia across contact boundaries between grains on the TiO2 support surface, where they may be immobilized again if Uint is sufficiently high. A thick film, even a monolayer of vanadia may thus extend from the contact-boundary onto the TiOa surface. If Uint is weak it is possible to observe agglomeration rather than spreading [90]. (iii) Another reaction is the oxidation (or ammoxidation) or toluene to benzal- dehyde and benzonitrile in which TiOa anatase and (B) forms have been used. Sanati et al. [91] have observed that an almost complete monolayer of vanadia can be formed on anatase, and on TiO2(B) too. The monolayer capacity of anatase was estimated about 70-75% of a theoretical layer in agreement with that obtained by other authors [89,90], although much lower values were found elsewhere [27,28,92-97]. According to chemical analysis, the average oxidation number of vanadium in monolayer is 4.8, indicating 80% of V5+ species and 20% V4+ species. The results found by Sanati et al. are in close agreement with those of Gasior et al. [98] who reported a value of 15% of V4+ around monolayer coverage. The ESR spectrum indicates a high degree of va+-v4+ interaction, but, on all supports, vanadium is present as V5+ on the top of the monolayer. The character- ization of rutile-supported samples seems to show that the support interface is a solid solution of V4+ into TiO2 (rutile), the common oxide VO: having itself the rutile structure. Cavani et al. [99] found also both V4+ and V5+ species interacting strongly with anatase. However, they proposed that the true monolayer was built up from V4species since, on increasing in loading, the amount of V4+ species approached a theoretical monolayer. High resolution micrographs of the samples with the highest loading revealed the formation of amorphous vanadia on anatase and on rutile, whereas on TiOe(B), vanadia was found to grow coherently at the titania interface [ 100]. Indeed, according to Wallenberg et al. [ 100], vanadia phase could only be distinguished after prolonged exposure of the sample to a fully converged electron beam leading to reduction of VOx, which supposes an 'epitactic' growth process upon deposition of vanadia on TiOa(B). Chemical analysis showed that vanadia interacting with TiOz(B) is in oxidation state +4, with possibly a VOz(B)-like structure, the vanadium tetrahedral coordination in the monolayer being due to the atomic scale roughness of TiO2(B) surface [100]. (iv) Recently the Eurocat group worked out physical and chemical analysis of fresh catalysts V2Os/TiO2 (anatase) with different loadings but coming from the same batch prepared by Rh6ne-Poulenc [4]. Catalytic tests were run and char- acterizations were done by various techniques (XRD, electron microscopy, TGA- DTA, TRR, IR and UV-visible spectroscopies, 51NMR, XPS, SIMS, electrical conductivity). The results suggest that, as vanadium loading is increased, mono- meric vO~ species, then domains of polymeric V-O-V species (polyvanadates) are seen on the fresh surface catalyst, and then V205 crystallites begin to grow at the expense of polyvanadates. Eurocat results [4] confirm those already published in 1992 by Went et al. [101], who studied the reactivity of V2Os/TiO2 (anatase) 56 P. Courtine, E. Bordes/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 45~55 catalysts under both oxidizing and reducing conditions. One oxygen per vanadium atom is lost, and comes from V=O groups of the monomeric and polymeric species preferentially to the bridging oxygen atom. This last statement is not in accordance with the findings of Deo et al. [102]. (v) The results obtained by various characterization methods for monolayers on MxOy supports (M=Ti, Nb, Zr, A1, Si) have been recently summarized and interpreted by Deo et al. [102]. Although the structure of the monolayer is said to be the same on the various supports, the reactivity depends on the nature of the support. The ease of reduction of the supported oxide catalyst depends on the strength of the V-O-support bonds, which determines the number of participating surface vanadium oxide sites, and consequently the pre-exponential factor. Turn- over frequencies in methanol oxidation were found similar for 1 wt% monolayer on Nb2Os, TiO2 and ZrO2 (0.8 to 3.3 s-l), while those with SiO2 and ~/-A1203 were differing by some orders of magnitude (3.9x 10-3 and 3.610-2 s-1, respec- tively). It is concluded that, since the same surface species are present whatever the support is, \"the difference in reactivity is not due to a structural factor\". (vi) Anatase supported VPOx and VOx monolayers have been used in our laboratory as catalysts for the oxidation of ethane to acetic acid [50]. The catalytic results show that the yield of acetic acid increases with vanadium loading up to a plateau when crystallites of V205 are detected by XRD. F-I'-IR bands in the range 970--995 cm-1 were detected for all samples except at low coverage, and were assigned to bidimensional polyvanadates containing vanadyl groups [4]. Increas- ing the loading up to the value of theoretical monolayer (V/Ti=I 1.4 mol%) leads to an enhancement of selectivity in acetic acid at the same conversion. The selectivity then remains the same for V/Ti>I 1.4 mol% when [VOx]~ polyvana- dates coexist with V205 crystallites. The comparison with VPO~/TiO2 shows that VOx/TiO2 catalysts are generally more active but less selective. For a composition corresponding to the theoretical monolayer (V/Ti: 5.2 and 11.4 mol% for VPO~ and VOx, respectively), selectivities are higher at similar conversion with VPO~ (Table 4).

The V2Os--ReO3-1ike oxides system Before using supported vanadium oxide monolayers as m the previous example, we had studied, among other bulk oxides, the catalyst of the [MOO3, V205, Nb205] system disclosed by Thorsteinson et al. [8] for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene. These authors showed that the best composition was MoN/ Nb-0.73/0.18/0.09, close to MOl6VnNb2. A very high selectivity to ethylene (82 mol%) at ethane conversion 29 mol% were observed at moderate temperature (286, CzH4/O2/N2=9/6/85; space velocity 340 h-1, 1 atm). Similar figures have been obtained more recently by other authors [46-48]. Somorjai et al. [49] have confirmed that to be active and selective the catalyst must contain the three elements Mo, V and Nb, the highest selectivity (93%) being obtained for MoN/ Nb---19/5/1. However, in these studies, the role of the solid state chemistry of the ternary oxide catalyst in the reaction was poorly addressed. Using the same Mol6WnNb2 composition, but preparing the samples with either oxalic acid or hydrochloric acid [9,10], we have obtained different phases by XRD than Mo6V9040 or MoaV6025 proposed in [8] (Table 5). Solid solutions of Mo~8052 and Mo5014-type [103] have been found and supposed to contain V and/or Nb which could not be detected as oxides. Indeed, vanadium and niobium are known to enter their lattice and to stabilize these phases [103]. Structurally related to ReO3 family, these molybdenum suboxides would be formed by CS plane mechanism progressively during the transient state, until the steady state is reached. The presence of Mo18052-type is related to the formation of ethylene with SEth--68 and SAc. acid=25 mol% (250, Conv.=3 mol%), confirming the results obtained by other authors. In the second case, IV, Nb] substituted Mo5014 phases seem to be responsible for the production of acetic acid in the same conditions (250, C--3.5 mol%) at a very high selectivity (97 mol%). In the two cases, these active phases, i.e. Nb or V substituted Mo18Ose and Mo5014, were thought to be embedded in a matrix of MOO3. In such a way, the active sites of these micro- domains would be more isolated than in pure MoO3, and consecutive oxidation of acetic acid or C2H4 to CO2 could be decreased. Models of these sites are proposed (Figs. 3 and 4), which show that small distortions of the lattice are needed for Mo5Ol4 to be accommodated in the MoO3 matrix.

In the case of Mo18052-type solid solution, these tetrahedral positions are numerous enough to be filled by niobium which uses this coordination, yielding a material with theoretical composition close to MOl6V4Nb2. Vanadium would mostly substitute molybdenum in octahedral coordination. 5. The supported heteropolycompounds containing vanadium Recently, we have studied the stabilization of heteropolymolybdic acids in the oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutyric acid to methacrylic acid [61-63]. Both thermal stability and catalytic performances of compounds of the series H3+nPVnMo12-xO40 (x=l, 2, 3) were shown to be enhanced by impregnating heteropolyacid samples on insoluble heteropolysalts K3PMo1204o [54--58,60]. It was argued [55] that heteropolyacids are stabilized because of an epitaxial relationship with the support, and the isomorphous acid layers were described as hexahydrates of the respective acids. Among the various supports we used [61-63], the best ones are K3PM012040 and silica doped with potassium. We have P. Courtine, E. Bordes/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 45~55 59 Fig. 4. Structure of M018052 (after [103]). Slabs of MoO3-type are connected above and below by Mo in tetrahedral position which can accommodate V and/or Nb. shown that, in the latter case, potassium added as promoter leads to the crystal- lization of silica as cristobalite during the calcination at 850, and that meanwhile potassium diffuses to the surface of silica so as to form Si-O-K+ bonds [63]. Impregnation by H3PMo~204o would lead to the formation, in the external layer of silica, of a potassium heteropolyanion, like K3PMo1204o, or KxHl_xPMo12040, the structure of which is cubic. Indeed, a cubic phase is observed by XRD (instead of tetragonal H4PMoalVOno.13H20) each time the catalytic properties of HaPMo11VO40 are good and its stability is high. The formation of layer(s) of KxHl_xPMol2Oa0-type on the surface of K-SiO2 (cristobalite) would be respon- sible for the anchoring of the active HnPMol 1VO40 phase of cubic symmetry. Such a cubic phase has recently been detected at steady state during a catalytic study followed by in situ XRD [104]. To observe good catalytic properties, the silica support must be crystallized, and cristobalite gives better results than trydimite (61-63). The necessary presence of cristobalite, which is related to the presence of K, is significant: if Si-O-K+ were randomly dispersed as in an amorphous silica with high surface area, some clusters of K3PMo12Oa0-type could be formed but the anchoring of HnPMOl 1VO40 would be only local. There would be no reason to find a potassium heteropolysalt ordered enough so as to be detected by XRD. Moreover, no modification of the XRD pattern of H4PM01 iVO4o, from tetragonal to cubic, would be seen. To account for its stabilization, a 2D anchoring has to be considered, otherwise H4PMollVO4o would lose its specificity as an active and 60 P Courtine, E. Bordes/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 45-65 Fig. 5. Model of H4PMo~IVO4o heteropolyacid anchored on silica doped with potassium. Four Keggin units are represented (very large shaded circles), some water, potassium and H+ (not represented) being located in between (large dotted circle). Oxygens over the silica framework of cristobalite are supposed to be covered with OH groups. Potassium ions are supposed to ensure the continuity between doped silica and the heteropolyacid. selective phase for oxidative dehydrogenation of IBA. Fig. 5 proposes a model of what could be such an anchoring. The fact that the activity of H4PMo11VO4o increases when it is supported could be thought usual, but, generally speaking, the activity increases when surface area increases. The reverse effect is observed here [63]. This is one more example of the importance of the surface crystal field exhibited by the catalyst, which chemically polarizes the molecule so as to transform it selectively [12,76], and of the synergic effect which is induced by a convenient support [11]. 6. Discussion and conclusion In the various examples of supported or mixed oxide catalysts, except the case of heteropolyacids, common features are exhibited by the active crystalline phases which are related to activity and selectivity in mild oxidation reactions [ 11,12,76]: (i) The presence of transition metal ions having high formal charges, such as V5+, V4+, Mo6+, Mo5+, Nb5+, with easy change of valence and coordination. Redox couples such as Vs+/v4+ or Mo6+/Mo5+, are adapted to a Mars and van Krevelen kinetic mechanism. (ii) Layered morphology, and low Tammann temperature allowing wetting and/ or spreading onto supports for vanadia catalysts. t~ Courtine, E. Bordes/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 45-65 61 (iii) Close structural relationship with ReO3 structure, even for the support. The consideration of the bulk properties as a guide is fruitful, even in the case of monolayers, as seen below. (iv) Mechanism of reduction by nucleation of crystallographic shear planes allowing extended defects to be formed (also valid for VOPO4); deeper reduction can also proceed during the transient state. Owing to these common features, microdomains, the interfaces of which can be coherent, can be formed during the transient state and be kinetically but not thermodynamically stable during the steady state. Complex oxide systems com- posed with three ReO3-1ike phases fulfilling the preceding conditions, i.e. V205, MoO3 and Nb205 can be more active for a given composition for which the number and quality of contacts is supposed to be optimum. Mixed oxides of ReO3-type with Nb205 have been proposed for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, which showed interesting selectivities at low conversion [ 105-107]. However, the chemistry of solid phases in heterogeneous catalysis is a rather low temperature chemistry. In the very well crystallized phases synthesized at high temperature, for the synthesis of superconductors for instance, boundaries of microdomains are very well defined by HRTEM. It is difficult in our cases to show by electron microscopy whether the microdomains boundaries are coherent or not. As underlined by Haber [87], the dynamic state of oxide surfaces is also to be taken into consideration. When the cohesion energy of an oxide is smaller than its adhesion energy to the surface of another oxide, its migration over the surface support can occur as the manifestation of \"wetting\", and spontaneous \"spread- ing\" takes place. However, this phenomenon is more general (provided the Tamman temperature is low) and does not lead always to synergic effects in catalysis or in non-catalytic conditions. Such effects are seen, for example in oxidation of o-xylene, with V205]TiO2 but not when V205 is supported on alumina, although spreading can be observed [88]. An alternative concept is proposed by Delmon et al. who explain the synergy effect by the spillover of oxygen. Oxygen would be activated at the surface of a \"donor\"-type oxide and supplied through this spillover to the surface of the \"acceptor\"-type oxide, thus generating new active centers which accelerate the reaction. This concept was applied, e.g., to the N-ethyl formamide dehydration on the [MoO3-Sb204] system at 350-390 [108-110]. In this case the Tammann temperature of the two oxides in contact is very low. If it is still difficult to fully characterize the surface of a solid, it is at least possible to foresee by the knowledge of its morphology and crystal structure, not only what are the surface lattice planes statistically exposed, but also the structural relationships between the surface and the bulk or, at least, of the few layers below the surface. For example, the crystal structure of both V205 and TiO2 (anatase form) are closely related and derive from a cubic compact arrangement, whereas the rutile structure is very different since it derives from a hexagonal compact arrangement. Therefore it is logical to think that the bidimensional arrangement of 62 P. Courtine, E. Bordes/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 45-65 atoms in the two solids, i.e. V205 and Tit2 anatase, is different from that of Tit2 rutile. A spreading of V205 was found possible indeed on the surface of anatase but not on the surface of rutile [32,95], whereas SEM showed that platelets of V205 crystallites were growing perpendicularly to rutile surface [78]. It can be added that the surface polyvanadates found on monolayer supported catalysts are in fine closely related to the chains of edge-shared octahedra found in V205. When monolayer catalysts began to be studied, their reactivity seemed com- pletely different from that of bulk catalysts. There is no doubt that polyvanadates are active in many reactions, including the oxidation of ethane to acetic acid [50]. But one could ask why and how monomeric tetrahedral species like those found at low coverage could be selective enough so as to provide the 12 electrons and six oxygens (three for phthalic anhydride and three for water formation) in the selective oxidation of o-xylene. Another striking point is the low availability of oxygen (one oxygen released by vanadium) exhibited by monolayers. It could be normal that the similar behavior was found whatever the support when studying methanol oxidation to formaldehyde, which is a poorly demanding reaction (2-e exchanged, one O to make water). On the other hand, many authors that we have cited have shown that \"amorphous\" surface layers of octahedrally distorted vanadia were displayed on the surface of anatase. Such an arrangement seems more appropriate for highly demanding reactions. With a similar idea in mind, we proposed that dimeric species structurally close to those in (VO)2P207 would bring more selectivity than the kind of chains in V205 because of site isolation due to the presence of phosphate groups [50]. Taking into account the redox mechan- ism which may lead, at the end of the transient state, to a more or less reduced catalyst which actually works at the steady state, it is always necessary to characterize the spent catalyst and not only the fresh one. A good example is provided by the work of Centi et al., [86], who finally showed that the behavior of their bulk supported catalysts was exactly comparable after 1000 h to that of the monolayer samples. It is worthwhile to consider the case of supported heteropolyacids. These molecular entities could be supposed at first to behave differently from the layer, polymer-like oxides examined above. However, the easy adaptation of the amount of water and protons between the Keggin units according to the degree of hydration and to the kind of reaction results in a remarkable \"elasticity\" of the heteropolyacid lattice allowing its anchoring on suitable supports. This seems to be the case when K-doped cristobalite or heteropolysalts K3PMo1204o are used as supports, so that the lattice of the heteropolyacid adopts a cubic symmetry. In conclusion, from these recent findings, one could say that a classification of monophasic or multiphasic mild oxidation catalyst begins to emerge, even if a full understanding of the surface and interracial phenomena occurring in these reac- tions is not yet straightforward. To progress, supplementary experiments suggested by new concepts would be necessary. P. Courtine, E. Bordes/Applied Catalysis A: General 157 (1997) 45~55 63 References [1] M.S. Wainwright and N.R.

Bordes Département de Génie Chimique, Université de Technologie de Compiègne, BP 529, 60205 Compiègne Cedex, France ∗ Corresponding author. Vanadium oxide or V-containing systems are extensively used as components of various catalysts used in mild oxidation, ammoxidation and dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons and other organic compounds. The discussed examples are the definite phases (VPO, butene and butane oxidations), supported bulk and monolayers (VTiO, o-xylene oxidation), and mixed oxides (VMoNbO, ethane oxidation). The common structural features are commented. Heteropolyacids, which can be stabilized either on structurally related heteropolysalts or on silica doped with potassium, are also considered as they contain similar molecular sites. The model of coherent interfaces, proposed to explain the synergic effects exhibited by most of these catalysts, is discussed and compared with concepts of other authors.

        "dc:description": "Vanadium oxide or V-containing systems are extensively used as components of various catalysts used in mild oxidation, ammoxidation and dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons and other organic compounds. The discussed examples are the definite phases (VPO, butene and butane oxidations), supported bulk and monolayers (VTiO, o-xylene oxidation), and mixed oxides (VMoNbO, ethane oxidation). The common structural features are commented. Heteropolyacids, which can be stabilized either on structurally related heteropolysalts or on silica doped with potassium, are also considered as they contain similar molecular sites. The model of coherent interfaces, proposed to explain the synergic effects exhibited by most of these catalysts, is discussed and compared with concepts of other authors.",
