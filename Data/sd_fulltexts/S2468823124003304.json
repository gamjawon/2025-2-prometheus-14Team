Phytic acid assisted glucose one-step method was used to prepare a Cu-based catalyst, thereby promoting the preparation of acetaldehyde from acetylene hydration. The Cu-PC8 catalyst showed high performance with acetylene conversion reaching as high as 96.9 % and an impressive selectivity of 88.1 % towards acetaldehyde, under a reaction temperature of 220 oC. Furthermore, it demonstrated good stability for up to 30 h, surpassing the performance of previous acetylene hydration catalysts using P-modified carbon as the carrier in existing literature. TEM analysis showed that the P-modified carbon material could effectively enhance the dispersion of copper, which is an active component, and prevent the aggregation of metals. XPS showed that P from phytic acid improved the catalytic performance by decreasing the electron cloud density around the copper species and increasing the content of the active components Cu2+ and Cu+.

It plays a vital role as an essential ingredient in the chemical sector, facilitating the manufacturing of diverse chemicals, including pentaerythritol, acetate, sorbic acid, etc., with an annual output of more than 106 tons in the world [1–4]. Among different industrial routes for acetaldehyde production, the hydration of acetylene process stands out as one of the most promising methods due to China's abundant coal reserves [5]. Early mercury salt catalysts for acetylene hydration were inconsistent with current international concepts of green chemistry [6]. Precious metals were rarely studied in this field because of their high price and low activity[7]. At present, many researches focused on non-precious metals such as Zn and Cu instead. For zinc-based catalysts, molecular sieve carrier and ligand modification are mainly investigated in recent years. Wang et al. analyzed the effect of heteroatom N-modified MCM-41 carrier, as well as metal atom (Ti and Zr atoms) doped carriers on catalyst performance [8–11]. Chen et al. explored that the introduction of TfOH ligand could form a stable TfO-ZnOH conformation with Zn, in which OH− participated in the reaction, thus reducing the energy barrier, and the acetylene conversion rate is up to 96 % [12]. As far as copper-based catalysts are concerned, they have been widely used in the field of acetylene hydration due to their large natural reserves, low cost and superior initial catalytic performance. Despite the rapid progress of Cu-based catalysts in recent researches, Cu-based catalysts with P-modified carbon materials as carriers still suffer from poor stability [13,14]. Thus, the development of a green and sustainable high efficiency Cu-based catalyst is highly necessary from both an industrial and environmental perspective. Carbon-based materials, are considered promising materials for catalyst supports ​due to their stable chemical properties, wide source of raw materials and low price, adjustable pore structure and surface properties, etc [15–17]. However, the electron density of the original carbon is evenly distributed along the carbon layer, resulting in a lack of active phase anchors, which affects the catalytic performance [18]. Heteroatom doping can adjust the charge distribution of carbon-based materials, and form new active sites [19–21]. Among these heteroatoms, the presence of vacant 3d orbitals and valence electrons in the P atoms facilitates their interaction with reactants [22]. Moreover, P atoms can form copper phosphate species with copper, which inhibits the loss of separated Cu2+ ions and the agglomeration of CuOx, and improves catalysts stability [23]. P atoms can accept electrons transferred from Cu while altering the electron cloud density around the metal, causing the peak of copper to move towards higher binding energy, and has been shown to be an effective dopant in acetylene hydration [13,14,24,25]. Phytic acid, a P-containing biosourced compound commonly found in legumes and grains, is an excellent precursor for the production of P-containing carbon materials without the need for additional phosphorus-containing reagents [18]. Yang et al. found that phytic acid can be esterified with starch, and P-doped hard carbon materials can be obtained after carbonization [26]. Therefore, the modification of carbon-based materials with phytic acid as a P source is an effective strategy for the preparation of P-containing Cu-based catalysts. Based on the above research, a simple and effective one-step method was adopted in this work, with phytic acid as P source and glucose as C source, and the active component CuCl2·2H2O was added to the precursor mixed solution to obtain Cu-based catalysts containing P after calcination. For the first time, a carbon-based carrier was modified by P without the combination of other heteroatoms, and the performance of the obtained Cu-based catalysts in promoting the acetylene hydration reaction was comprehensively investigated. The effects of phytic acid modified carbon-based materials on the catalysts' structure and catalytic performance were investigated through characterization techniques such as TEM, XRD, and XPS analysis, and catalyst performance testing. It has been proven that the Cu-based catalyst prepared by phytic acid assisted glucose one-step method exhibits favorable catalytic activity and stability. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Materials CuCl2·2H2O (AR), and phytic acid (50 %) were provided by Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd., C6H12O6·H2O (AR) was purchased from Tianjin Shengao Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Ultrapure Milli-Q water (18.25 MΩ· cm) was used in this work. 2.2 Preparation of Cu-PxCy catalysts Cu-PxCy catalysts were prepared by one step synthesis method (Scheme 1 ). In a typical synthesis of Cu-PC8, firstly, 5 mmol CuCl2·2H2O and 5 mmol phytic acid were dispersed into 20 mL 2 mol/L glucose solution with stirring for 24 h under room temperature. Then, the homogeneous solution was dried at 80 oC for 12 h to get the catalysts precursor. Finally, the precursor was removed into a ceramic boat and carbonized at 450 oC for 3 h (heating rate: 3 oC/min) under N2 atmosphere. When cooled to room temperature, the carbonated product named Cu-PC8 catalyst was obtained. The catalysts with different amounts of phytic acid and glucose were prepared by the same method, and the obtained catalysts were named Cu-PxCy (x: molar ratio of CuCl2·2H2O to phytic acid; y: molar ratio of CuCl2·2H2O to glucose). For comparison, Cu-C8 catalyst without phytic acid, PC8 catalyst without Cu and simple carbon material without phytic acid and copper were prepared as control groups. 2.3 Catalyst characterization The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained by a Bruker DX-27MINI over a 2θ scan range of 10–80° using Cu Kα radiation operated with 40 kV and 10 mA. The Raman spectra were acquired with a Bruker Raman spectrometer. The surface area, pore volume and distribution of pore size were measured on an AMI TOP-200 instrument using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The morphology and microstructure were characterized by Hitachi SU8010 scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Hitachi HT7700 transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and FEl Talos F200x high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM). The surface chemical compositions were analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha instrument using Al Kα radiation. The content of the elements in the digested catalyst was tested using a Thermo ICAP-6300 instrument. The extended X-Ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra were obtained at the X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) station of Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF, China). 2.3 Catalytic performance evaluation The equipment of catalyst performance evaluation was a continuous fixed-bed microreactor equipped with a 10 mm inner diameter reaction tube, and acetylene hydration reaction was carried out with 2 mL samples at ambient pressure. First, the programmed heating was carried out in the atmosphere of nitrogen. When the temperature reached 200 oC, water vapor was used to activate the catalyst at a flow rate of 0.075 mL/min for 30 min. After activation, the catalytic performance was assessed under the reaction temperature of 220 oC, the water-gas ratio of n(H2O)/n(C2H2) = 4 and GHSVC2H2 = 90 h− 1. The obtained products were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC-2014C) after low temperature condensation to liquid phase. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Morphology and structure of catalysts The morphology and microstructure of the catalysts were analyzed using SEM and TEM, and the corresponding results presented in Fig. 1 . In Fig. 1a-b, it can be observed that the catalysts prepared by one-step method have a similar morphology, and the addition of phytic acid does not destroy its structure, which is mainly an irregular layered structure. And the surface of those layers is smooth. The morphology of the fresh catalysts is further investigated by TEM images. Aggregation of black copper particles is observed in the Cu-C8 sample (Fig. 1c), but no significant copper particles are observed after the addition of phytic acid (Fig. 1d). Moreover, the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping of the Cu-C8 and Cu-PC8 catalysts in Fig. 1e-f shows Cu, C, and O elements, and the presence of P in the Cu-PC8 catalyst is uniformly distributed. From the copper element mapping of the HAADF image, it can be seen that the Cu species of Cu-PC8 catalyst after adding phytic acid are highly dispersed, suggesting that phytic acid enhances the dispersibility of the active component copper. The favorable catalytic performance can be achieved due to the high dispersion of Cu [27]. It's further hypothesized that the Cu-based catalysts prepared by phytic acid-assisted glucose one-step method may exert a beneficial influence on the process of acetylene hydration. At the same time, the distribution of O has a certain correlation with the distribution of Cu, and it is speculated that copper oxides are formed. Fig. 2a shows XRD spectra at different carbonization temperatures. The diffraction peak of CuCl is detected at the carbonization temperature of 250 oC, which may be due to the low temperature inability to completely break the Cu-Cl bonds. When the carbonization temperature rises to 850 oC, the detected Cu0 diffraction peak is caused by the sintering and aggregation of copper itself. XRD spectra of fresh simple C material, PC8 and Cu-PxC8 catalysts (x = 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10) are shown in Fig. 2b and Fig. S1a. All samples have a wide diffraction peak at about 24°, corresponding to the (002) faces of the carbon material [28]. The diffraction peak of Cu2O is detected in the fresh Cu-C8 catalyst, which proves that there is Cu2O crystal phase in the catalyst prepared by one-step method without phytic acid. The results further confirm that there is indeed a correlation between the distribution of Cu and O in elemental mappings. Moreover, no diffraction peaks associated with copper species appeared in the catalyst after the addition of phytic acid, and in conjunction with the Cu elemental mapping of EDX, inferring that the copper is uniformly dispersed on the carbon-based carriers or exists in an amorphous form. After 10 h of reaction, for the Cu-based catalyst used, three distinct Cu0 diffraction peaks appeared at 43.2°, 50.3°, and 73.9°, indexed as (111), (200), and (220) lattice planes, respectively, according to PDF#03–065–9026 card, indicating that Cu species were sinter-reduced during the reaction process (Fig. S1b) [29]. But the peak strength of the Cu-metal phase in the used Cu-PC8 sample is obviously lower than that of the used Cu-C8 sample, indicating that its content is relatively low, and the addition of phytic acid can alleviate the reduction of copper to a certain extent. The Raman spectra in Fig. 2c demonstrate the presence of a G-band (∼1580 cm−1) associated with sp2 and a D-band (∼1340 cm−1) associated with sp3 in Cu-C8 and Cu-PC8 catalysts [30]. Moreover, the ID/IG ratio can serve as an indicator of the degree of defects, and the addition of phytic acid leads to an increase in the ID/IG value from 0.88 to 0.98, indicating the degree of defects within the carbon layer of Cu-PC8 catalyst increased. The wide range of XPS spectra displayed in Fig. 2d demonstrates the presence of Cu, C, and O elements across all catalysts and confirms the successful doping of phosphorus atoms into the catalyst by the presence of P element in the Cu-PC8 catalyst. The porosity and specific surface area of all samples were investigated by N2 adsorption desorption method. The results illustrated in Fig. 2e indicate that the adsorption capacity of Cu-P0.5C8 and Cu-PC8 catalysts increases dramatically when the relative pressure P/P0 < 0.1, and there is a significant H4 hysteretic loop between 0.2–0.8, which exhibits an IV type of mesoporous adsorption isotherm. With the increase of phytic acid content, the hysteresis loop disappears, the isotherm become type III, the micropores decrease, and the mesopores increase sharply. Meanwhile, the detailed pore structure parameters of each sample are presented in Table S1, the specific surface area of the simple C material is only 3.66 m2/g, and the specific surface area increases to 35.28 m2/g after adding phytic acid. It indicates that phytic acid increases the specific surface area of carbon materials in the complex process, including the dehydration, pore-forming, crosslinking and aromatization [26]. As the increase of phytic acid content, the specific surface area first increases and then decreases (Fig. 2f). The Cu-PC8 catalyst has a maximum specific surface area of 83.45 m2/g, and the microporosity is 52 %, which is twice that of the mesopore. The findings show that the excessive inclusion of phytic acid in the Cu-based catalysts will reduce the specific surface area. 3.2 The catalytic performance of catalysts Fig. 3a -b show the screening of calcination temperature, and it can be observed that the performance of this catalyst is not ideal after low or high temperature calcination, which agrees with the XRD findings depicted in Fig. 2a. Experiments show that 450–650 oC is a good calcination temperature range, considering the problem of energy consumption, the final calcination temperature is 450 oC (Cu loading and reaction temperature screening are shown in Fig. S2). On this basis, the catalytic properties of different amounts of phytic acid additions were tested (Fig. 3c-d). The catalytic performance and stability of the Cu-C8 catalyst are unsatisfactory in the acetylene hydration reaction. After the reaction for 9 h, the acetylene conversion decreases from 78.8 % to 47.5 %. The addition of phytic acid significantly enhanced the catalyst's catalytic efficiency. Optimal conversion and selectivity were achieved at a molar ratio of 1: 1 between phytic acid and Cu. At this time, the Cu content in the Cu-PC8 catalyst is 6.5 wt% and the P content is 9.9 wt% (Table S2). The acetaldehyde selectivity and acetylene conversion of Cu-PC8 catalyst can reach 88.1 % and 96.9 % within 10 h reaction time. Comparison of their performance with the catalysts prepared by the two-step method reveals that the one-step method has the best catalytic performance (two-step catalyst preparation method and performance evaluation in supplementary information Fig. S3) Fig. 3e-f show the stability tests of the Cu-based catalysts when subjected to optimal reaction conditions. The acetaldehyde selectivity of the Cu-PC8 catalyst decreased marginally from 87.6 % to 83.1 %, representing only a minor decrease of 4.5 %, over a reaction time of 30 h. Conversely, the acetaldehyde selectivity of Cu-C8 catalyst exhibited a sharp decline from 51.7 % to 9.2 %. Apparently, the incorporation of phytic acid effectively enhances the catalytic performance of the Cu-based catalysts in acetylene hydration, and the Cu-PC8 catalyst exhibits superior stability in the acetylene hydration reaction compared to previously reported Cu-based catalysts. These findings validate the feasibility and potential advantages associated with one-step synthesis using phytic acid assisted glucose for preparing acetylene hydrated Cu-based catalysts. 3.3 Surface chemical properties of Cu-based catalysts The XPS O 1s and P 2p spectra were utilized to analyze the chemical states of near-surface elements, aiming to provide additional insights into the significant contribution of phytic acid in facilitating the one-step synthesis of Cu-based catalysts (Fig. S4 and Fig. 4a ). The O 1s XPS spectra are divided into three distinct components, representing the O-Cu, P=O band at 531.5 eV, the O=C bond at 532.6 eV, and the O-C, P-O-P band at 533.7 eV [31,32]. The presence of O-Cu bond confirms the presence of copper oxide, which is consistent with the results of elemental mapping of EDX. None of the oxygen fractions of the Cu-C8 catalyst changed significantly after the reaction, and the O 1s spectrum of the Cu-PC8 catalyst (Fig. S4b) showed a large signal peak area at 531.5 eV. In addition, the binding energy of P shifted to a higher direction after the reaction of the Cu-PC8 catalyst, which may be due to the presence of interactions between the P atoms and the active component copper species during the reaction. Since the key active component of the acetylene hydration reaction is the copper species, it is crucial to study the surface chemical state of copper. Fig. 4c-f show the XPS analysis of Cu 2p and Cu LMM for the fresh and used Cu-based catalysts. According to the XPS results, the Cu 2p3/2 spectra can be separated into two peaks in a quantitative manner. The peak at a higher binding energy of 935.4 eV is associated with Cu2+ species, while the peak at a lower binding energy of 932.9 eV could potentially correspond to either Cu2O or metallic Cu (Fig. 4c-d) [33]. Compared with Cu-C8 catalyst without added phytic acid, the binding energy of the copper species in the Cu-PC8 catalyst was positively shifted from 935.4 eV to 936.1 eV, indicating the interaction between copper and phosphorus with electron transfer. The electron absorption effect of P has been confirmed to effectively decrease the electron cloud density surrounding Cu, thereby promoting its interaction with reactants and enhancing catalytic efficiency [34]. Furthermore, by analyzing the XPS Cu 2p and P 2p spectra of fresh and used Cu-PC8 catalysts (Fig. 4a and 4d), it was evident that the binding energy position of Cu shifted towards lower binding energy after the reaction, while that of phosphorus shifted towards higher binding energy, reconfirming the existence of an interaction between the Cu and the P. Further distinction between Cu+ and Cu0 species were made by Cu LMM X-ray excited auger spectroscopy (XAES) spectrum (Fig. 4e-f). After curve fitting, three distinct peaks are observed at 908–921 eV, where the main peak with a binding energy of about 915.4 eV belongs to Cu2+ or Cu+, and the one near the binding energy of 918.6 eV is attributed to Cu0 [35,36]. The proportions of Cu2+, Cu+ and Cu0 are presented in Fig. 4b by analyzing the peak areas after deconvolution. It can be found that the proportion of Cu+ in the Cu-C8 catalyst significantly surpasses that in the Cu-PC8 catalyst, which aligns with the XRD results of the presence of Cu2O crystalline phase. After the addition of phytic acid, the proportion of Cu2+ in the Cu-PC8 catalyst increased by 26 %, and the catalytic performance was substantially improved. Cu2+ may be the main active component of this reaction, and phytic acid leads to an increase in the active component Cu2+. Compared with fresh Cu-based catalysts, the increase of Cu+ and Cu0 content in all catalysts after the reaction can be observed, indicating that the addition of phytic acid did not inhibit the reduction of high-valent Cu (II) during the reaction. The morphology and degree of agglomeration of the used Cu-based catalyst metals were characterized by TEM and analyzed in terms of particle size as shown in Fig. 5 . The average size of metal grains in the used Cu-C8 catalyst (Fig. 5b) is measured to be approximately 89.10 nm, demonstrating there is obvious Cu species aggregation in the reaction. On the contrary, the average size of grains observed in the used Cu-PC8 catalyst is merely 9.15 nm (Fig. 5a), demonstrating a significant decrease which illustrates that phytic acid effectively inhibits agglomeration of Cu active sites and thus improves the performance of the Cu-based catalysts for acetylene hydration. 3.4 Dissection of the Cu coordination environment The electronic structure and coordination geometry of the central atom Cu were investigated by X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS) measurements, using CuO, Cu2O, and Cu foil as references. In the Cu K-edge spectra (Fig. 6a ), the curve of Cu-PC8 is located between Cu2O as well as CuO, indicating that the valence state of Cu, the central atom of the catalyst after carbonization is between +1 and +2 [37,38]. And it is also observed that the pre-edge peak is situated at around 8984 eV, which suggests that the coordination number of Cu of the catalyst after carbonization is between 2 and 3 [39]. As shown in the EXAFS curves of each sample in Fig. 6b, the peak at ∼ 2.2 Å for Cu foil corresponds to the Cu-Cu bond, and there is a distinct peak near ∼ 1.5 Å for Cu-PC8, CuO, and Cu2O, which is due to the presence of the Cu-O bond. Combined with the wavelet transform (Fig. 6f), this further demonstrates that most of the Cu in Cu-PC8 is stabilized in the form of Cu-O complexes. Further fitting of the synchrotron radiation data enables obtaining the precise coordination of the central atomic copper, which shows that the first shell coordination number for Cu-O at 1.94 Å is 3.1. This suggests that the Cu-O3 structural unit is formed by the combination of one Cu atom and three O atoms during the catalyst preparation (Table S3). These results indicate that the valence state of the central atom copper in the Cu-PC8 catalyst exists in both Cu2+ and Cu+ forms, and that the copper is coordinated with oxygen atoms to form a stable Cu-O3 structure. 4 Conclusion An efficient Cu-based catalyst for acetylene hydration was successfully prepared by one step method. Within 30 h, the acetylene conversion of Cu-PC8 catalyst remained above 91.9 %, and the acetaldehyde selectivity decreased by only 4.3 %. The activity and stability of the Cu-PC8 catalyst are superior to those of previous acetylene hydration catalysts with P-modified carbon as the carrier. The results of catalysts characterization confirmed that the binding energy of Cu species was transferred to a higher position by the electron absorption effect of P from phytic acid, which reduced the electron cloud density around Cu and made it easier to obtain excellent catalytic performance of acetylene hydration reaction. Furthermore, the addition of phytic acid greatly increased the content of active components Cu2+ and Cu+, inhibited the aggregation of copper species, and significantly improved the catalytic performance. Therefore, Cu-PC8 catalyst, as a high activity, low cost and green catalyst, will have a broad application prospect in the industrialization of acetylene hydration.

        "dc:description": "Phytic acid assisted glucose one-step method was used to prepare a Cu-based catalyst, thereby promoting the preparation of acetaldehyde from acetylene hydration. The Cu-PC8 catalyst showed high performance with acetylene conversion reaching as high as 96.9 % and an impressive selectivity of 88.1 % towards acetaldehyde, under a reaction temperature of 220 oC. Furthermore, it demonstrated good stability for up to 30 h, surpassing the performance of previous acetylene hydration catalysts using P-modified carbon as the carrier in existing literature. TEM analysis showed that the P-modified carbon material could effectively enhance the dispersion of copper, which is an active component, and prevent the aggregation of metals. XPS showed that P from phytic acid improved the catalytic performance by decreasing the electron cloud density around the copper species and increasing the content of the active components Cu2+ and Cu+.",
