Kinetic data concerning the reduction of the oxidized forms of model as well as industrial catalysts used in ammonia synthesis were obtained in dry and in wet atmosphere containing 1% water vapour. The data for the industrial catalyst have been reassessed using three kinetic models. Modifications applied to the classical Seth-Ross model of the shrinking-core type resulted in the best fitting of this equation to the experimental data. The failure of the crackling core model to describe the kinetic data in a quantitative way is tentatively explained. The reduction of model catalysts containing enhanced amounts of wustite and/or potassium proceeds initially linearly with time. The effect of promoters, and especially of potassium, is discussed in more detail. The magnetite-alumina subsystem is respon- sible for the retardation effect of the water vapour on the reduction rate. A hypothesis is formulated that -- in the presence of wustite or potassium --the inhibitive, Al-rich, hydrated surface layer is not effective in hindering the progress of the reduction process.

Introduction Since the second decade of the 20th century the ammonia synthesis has been carried out over a fused iron catalyst containing promoters such as A1203, K20 and CaO [ 1 ]. Only very recently preliminary information concerning the industrial application of the second- *Corresponding author. 0926-860X/94/$07.00 1994 Elsevier Science B.V.

Nevertheless, almost the entire production (ca. 100 mln ton/year) [3] is achieved in the classical way. The magnetite-like precursor of the catalyst (containing also wustite) is activated by reduction in industrial reactors or in specially built installations for production of the prereduced and passivated catalyst. Optimization of the reduction process requires, among others, some knowledge of the reduction rate as a function of the reduction degree (R), temperature, and the composition of the gas phase, particularly the water content [ 4]. The kinetics of reduction of iron oxides belongs to the fundamentals of metallurgy and is reviewed in numerous books (e.g. [5] ). As pointed out by Schl6gl [6], the reduction of industrial iron catalysts reveals different features due to the presence of promoters. An understanding of the behaviour of industrial catalysts is facilitated by the study of model catalysts. Their composition is simpler because at least one promoter (or wustite phase) is lacking. The kinetics of activation of fused iron catalysts has been studied in our research group for many years. The studies were reviewed in 1981 by Nielsen [ 7 ], and, recently, by Schl6gl [61. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, it adds new data concerning the reduction of industrial and model catalysts, with the accent laid on the latter. The second aim is to provide a unified description for all available data. Previous and new experimental results have been summarized under phenomenological kinetic equations. The particular aim is to show the range of validity of the proposed kinetic relationships. Some methodological problems of general importance are discussed too. Finally, let us take into account that the study of reduction processes can be labelled, in the extreme cases, as molecular events approach, single grain approach, and industrial bed approach. The middle label fits our study in the best way. In order to define the term \"grain\" it is enough to say that its characteristic dimension (in our case ca. 1 mm) is determined by the choice of the sieve fraction. 1.2. Abbreviations A1Kcatl-42 is a typical label of a model catalyst. It reads: doubly promoted (by A1 and K) catalyst containing 42. wt.-% of wustite. A letter M is added to the label if wustite is lacking, i.e. the catalyst is based on magnetite only. The letter U at the beginning denotes an unpromoted catalyst. The reducing atmosphere containing ca. 102 ppm and ca. 104 ppm of water vapour is called dry and wet, respectively. 2. Experimental 2.1. Samples Four industrial catalysts were studied. C.atalyst KMI produced by Haldor TopsCe AS, studied by us for many years is denoted as catalyst 4. A. Barallski et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 112 (1994) 13-36 The model catalysts were prepared under industrial conditions [ 8 ]. The content of A1203, K20 and CaO in singly promoted catalysts amounts to 4.3, 2.3 and 2.6 wt.-%, respectively. The composition of K,Al-doubly-promoted catalysts was the following: AlKcatl-29, 1.8 wt.-% of K20 and 3.1 wt.-% of A1203; A1Kcatl-6, 1.5 wt.-% of K20 and 3.7 wt.-% of A1203. In all catalysts, including the unpromoted ones, the content of impurities (Mg, Si, Ti, V, Ca, Na, Mn and Si) can be assumed to be the same as given in ref. [8]. 2.2. Apparatus and procedure The reduction process was monitored thermogravimetrically at atmospheric pressure using a McBain spring thermobalance, as described in ref. [9]. The reducing gas mixture was obtained by a catalytical decomposition of ammonia and by subsequent purification. The linear flow-rate amounted to 5-7 cm/s. If not otherwise stated, the experiments were carried out at standard conditions, i.e. at 500, using the grain sieve fraction 1.0-1.2 mm. A small, monolayer sample was placed in the perforated-wire thermobalance basket. Thus the water vapour formed in a grain did not affect other grains and the obtained data represented reduction phenomena occurring in the single grain of the catalyst. The wet atmosphere was obtained by saturating a fraction of the flowing gas by water vapour. Then the dry and saturated gases were mixed together. A more detailed description is available in ref. [ 10]. 3. The reduction of model catalysts 3.1. Linearity of the initial parts of kinetic curves During the reduction of the model catalysts, in contrast to the industrial ones, the begin- ning of a kinetic curve is often regarded as almost linear, especially if the catalyst contains a significant amount of wustite and/or potassium. The following samples: Alcatl-95, Ucatl- M, Ucatl-34, Ucatl-98, Kcatl-28 are the examples of such a behaviour. The typical kinetic curves for these catalysts are shown in Fig. 1. In order to be able to describe this behaviour quantitatively in a simple way, let us introduce an arbitrary definition of linearity. The curve is said to be linear within the range of reduction degrees from zero to L if the reduction rate (dR/dt)R = m is smaller than the initial rate (dR/dt)R =o by 5%. For the industrial catalysts and for the above-listed model catalysts the upper limits of the apparent linearity range vary from 7 to 10% and from 14 to 33%, respectively. These results enable us to avoid the use of kinetic equations for the rough description of experimental data. Instead, an application of the initial rates (or their ratios) facilitates reaching quickly simple conclusions. Comparison of the kinetic behaviour of two catalysts can be easily achieved when using the ratio of the initial rates. This is exemplified by the results concerning the effect of wustite and of potassium on the reduction rate. 3.2. The effect of wustite Temperature, composition of the catalyst and composition of the gas phase, especially the water content, are the main variables affecting the reduction rate.

A singly Al-promoted catalyst was chosen in order to show the simultaneous effect of the temperature, the water content and the wustite content on the reduction rate. This catalyst is the simplest model system which behaves during the reduction in a way similar to the industrial one. Selected experimental results are shown in Fig. 2 (a part of it, namely Figs. 2a and b are taken from paper [ 12 ] ). The heightened content of wustite, greater than that in the industrial catalyst, reveals the effect of wustite in a clear way. Comparison of the dry atmosphere data (Fig. 2a and 2c) shows that, although the reduction is faster in the presence of wustite, the general pattern of both figures remains similar. With the increase of temperature the reduction rate also increases in a more or less regular way. One can conclude from the comparison of the results obtained in the wet atmosphere (Fig. 2b and 2d) that, although the reduction in the presence of wustite is faster again, the general pattem of both figures is totally different. Kinetic curves for the wustite-rich sample Alcatl-22 can be seen for all presented temperatures. When wustite is absent the curves are A.

At the lower temperatures the reduction is too slow to be detected. These results are in perfect agreement with the previous data indicating that alumina dissolved in the magnetite matrix is responsible for the retardation effect of water vapour on the reduction rate [ 11 ]. However, an additional message of the recent results is a direct evidence of the simultaneous effect of temperature and the presence of wustite on the reduction rate. Even at the lowest temperature studied, namely at 450, the retardation effect is removed by wustite. The higher the temperature is, the weaker is the retardation effect [ 12], and, hence, the presence of wustite phase is less significant. Let us now try to quantify these results in a rough way, using the values of the initial rates (r) at the standard temperature 500. (i) The acceleration of the reduction in dry atmosphere due to the presence of 20-30% of wustite is expressed by the ratio of the initial rates of the pair of catalysts. For singly promoted catalyst it reads: r(Alcatl-22) 1.4 (1) r(Alcatl-M) For unpromoted catalyst this ratio has a similar value r(Ucatl-34) =2.0 (2) r(Ucatl-M) A.

The corresponding ratio rdry/rwe t for this catalyst is equal to 1.5. For the sake of comparison, let as note that for unpromoted catalyst Ucatl-34 the similar ratio amounts to 2.4. For alumina-promoted wustite Alcatl-95 the value of this ratio amounts to 2.2. It follows from these results that dramatic retardation of the reduction caused by water vapour is prevented when the catalyst contains at least 20-30 wt.-% of the wustite phase. 3.3. The effect of potassium A number of kinetic runs were carried out for the model catalysts containing potassium. In general, one can say that for these samples the linearity range is enhanced by the presence of wustite and it is depressed by the presence of alumina. The initial rates were used again to estimate the effect of potassium on the reducibility. The average values of r for all available data are summarized in the Table 1. In the extreme cases they are based on one and six measurements. The ratios of the initial rates can be seen in Fig. 3, and, hence, the following conclusions can be drawn directly: ( 1 ) potassium accelerates the reduction process; (2) the acceleration does not depend on the concentration of water in the reducing gas; (3) the acceleration is more significant for the samples containing alumina; (4) In contrast to singly Al-promoted catalyst [ 11 ], for doubly (K,Al)-promoted catalyst the acceleration of the reduction caused by wustite does not depend on the water content. The third conclusion is of special value for the purpose of further discussion. 3.4. The effect of catalyst composition on the reduction rate -- general discussion Let us imagine a consecutive addition of the following components of the industrial iron catalyst to unpromoted catalyst: alumina, a small amount of wustite (within the range of 5% to 11%), potassium, and calcium. In this way a series of model catalysts has been selected for the purpose of further discussion: Ucatl-M, Alcatl-M, Alcatl-(5-11 ), A1Kcatl- (5-11 ) and AICaKcatl-(5-11 ). In fact, the last formula approximates the composition of an industrial catalyst. A.

Kinetic curves for 4 model and one industrial catalyst, as approximated by the SR equation (500, dry atmosphere). In order to discuss the effect of promoters, let us compare the reducibility of the model and industrial catalysts. An additivity of the effects caused by various promoters is assumed as the first approximation. The kinetic curves for the catalysts listed above are shown in Fig. 4. The kinetic curve of Ucatl-M reveals significant linearity. Unpromoted catalyst is reduced significantly faster A.

The model catalysts were obtained from Nitrogen Compounds Plant, Tarn6w, Poland. The curve for catalyst 4 was taken from the data published in ref. [9], Table 2, expts. 36 and 37. than promoted ones. For this catalyst, the Seth-Ross (SR) equation (Eq. 4) does not fit the data, and the effect of water vapour on the reduction rate is weak [ 13]. Undoubtedly, the reduction behaviour of magnetite and the industrial catalyst is quite different. This idea was strongly emphasized by SchlSgl in his recent review [ 6]. The similarity of the reduction behaviour of catalyst 4 and of the promoted model catalysts is seen from Fig. 4. In the dry atmosphere the linearity range varies from 6-9% for all curves. The SR equation fits the data well. The highest r.st.d, for Alcatl-M sample amounts to 1.1%. For the remaining cases r.st.d. < 0.3%. The exact values are given in Fig. 4. Let us now emphasize the influence of particular components on the reducibility of the catalyst. Alumina slows down the reduction of fused iron catalyst [ 14]. The effect was once more confirmed in our laboratory when using a sample containing a very large amount of A1203, ca. 10 wt.-% [ 15]. The retarding effect of A1 on the reduction rate of a precipitated iron catalyst was shown by Yatsimirskij et al. [ 16]. Their kinetic curves were described by the equation: 1-(1-R)~/3=kt (3) where the rate constant k decreased monotonously with increasing A1203 content. Similar results were obtained by us for the fused catalyst [ 17] *. Kinetic curves are seen in Fig. 5. The Seth-Ross equation fits the data well, and the dependence of its parameter kr on the alumina content is shown in Fig. 6. Let us note that eq. (3) is a special case of the SR equation. The data presented in Fig. 5 were obtained for cubes of 1.9 mm edge, cut off from *All original protocols of these old experiments are available. Unfortunately, the samples are missing. Wustite content was not determined at that time. A.

For the sake of comparison, the curve for identical cubes of catalyst 4 is also shown in Fig. 5. The presence of A1 is a sine qua non condition for the appearance of a dramatic decrease of the reduction rate in the presence of water vapour. The effect of water is the critical factor in the reduction on industrial scale [6]. The effect depends on the composition of the catalyst, particularly on the content of magnetite and alumina [ 11,12]. Fig. 7 summarizes the results obtained in our laboratory. The ratio Rw/Rd of the reduction degree in wet atmosphere (Rw) to the reduction degree in dry atmosphere (Rd) taken after 100 min of reduction is an arbitrary measure of the effect. The lower the value of the ratio is, the more significant is the retardation effect of the water vapour. The absolute minimum of the surface seen on Fig. 7 corresponds, as expected, to the highest content of alumina and magnetite. The remaining features of Fig. 7 should not be taken into account. Too small a number of points was used for calculating the surface, and characterization of the effect by the ratio defined above is too crude. Our model catalysts were prepared under industrial conditions [ 8 ], and, unfortunately, a singly Al-promoted sample containing a small amount of wustite was not obtained. However, the sample Alcatl-22, containing 22% of wustite, was available. Reduction of this catalyst is faster than the reduction of Alcatl-M. It is quite probable that a similar conclusion would be true for Alcatl- (5-11 ) also, and the appropriate curve would be seen somewhere in between the Alcatl-M and Alcatl-22 curves. Potassium accelerates the rate of reduction of iron oxides [ 18,19 ]. The same is true in the case of fused iron catalyst [ 14 ]. The industrial catalyst contains potassium and is reduced faster then the model catalyst of the same alumina content (see Figs. 5 and 6). Additional data are presented in this paper. It can be seen from Fig. 4 that the reduction of the A1Kcatl- 6 sample is faster than that of singly Al-promoted catalysts. The enhancement of the potassium effect caused by the presence of alumina, seen in the Fig. 3, should be emphasized. This implies the necessity of a reassessment of the earlier assumption about additivity of A.

Rw/Rdis the ratio of reduction degrees attained after 100 min of reduction at wet and dry atmospheres. Magnetite contents are 10 times greater than values given. the promoter effects. The effect of potassium can be understood on the basis of literature data. From M6ssbauer spectrometry data, Yoshioka et al. [20] conclude that A1203 in a singly promoted catalyst goes into a solid solution with Fe304, whereas in the presence of K20 the formation of the solution is prevented to some degree. Sasa et al. [21 ] confirmed this conclusion by the X-ray measurements of lattice parameters for a series of the same samples. They found that, for the catalyst containing ca. 2.5 wt.-% of A1203, the amount of alumina in the magnetite phase decreases with the increase of K20 content above ca. 0.6%. In this context a possible bonding of K20 with A1203 is worth mentioning [22-24]. According to Yegubayev et al. [25], KAIO2 is formed during the reduction. Potassium aluminate is probably a surface compound because its presence was not confirmed by more recent X- ray diffraction measurements (with long ( 100 h) exposure times) performed by Rayment et al. [ 26]. Taking into account the above quoted papers, a hypothesis can be formulated that only the amount of alumina incorporated into the magnetite matrix is responsible for the retar- dation of the reduction rate. This implies that potassium not only accelerates the reduction rate itself but also removes to some extent the retardation caused by alumina. The model catalyst A1Kcatl-6 and the samples studied by Japanese authors are of similar composition (although the alumina content in the catalyst is somewhat greater, 3.7%), and, therefore, the explanation outlined above suits well with our data. The total accelerating effect of potassium is so significant that the reduction rate of AIKcatl-6 is even greater than the reduction rate of the industrial catalyst. The presence of calcium is the major difference A. Barahski et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 112 (1994) 13-36 between these catalysts. One can guess that calcium retards the reduction rate. This predic- tion was confirmed by the recent data showing that Cacatl-M sample is reduced more slowly than the Ucatl-M model catalyst [ 15]. 4. The reduction of industrial catalysts 4.1. Kinetic models applied in the present studies 4.1.1. Shrinking core model (SCM) The description of the model is available in monographs, e.g. in ref. [27]. The main assumptions are outlined below. The overall size of the solid grain does not change during the reduction. The solid product (Fe) forms an \"ash layer\", sometimes also called \"shell\", around the nonporous, solid core of the reactant (Fe304). The reaction occurs at a well defined interface between the unreacted core and the porous ash layer. The overall kinetic equation is of a mixed-control type and takes into account the chemical reactions at the interface as well as the diffusion of reactant gas (H2) and product gas (HzO) through the porous layer of the product. The external diffusion (gas-film) phenomena can usually be neglected. Three special cases of SCM will be briefly described below. 4.1.1.1. The original Seth-Ross (SR) equation. The equation proposed by Seth and Ross [28] was applied in our earlier paper [9]. The model takes into account a reversible, first- order reaction at the interface and the diffusion of hydrogen through the ash layer. The diffusion of water vapour is not taken into account. The final kinetic equation is as follows: t=MsR [1--(I-R) I/3]+NsR[ 1 R (1-R)2/3] 3 (4) doro MSR (5) kd Co -c~) dor~ NSR (6) k~( co -C~q) where: t is time of reaction [s], ka is diffusion constant [g/(cm s mol) ], kp is rate constant of the interface chemical reaction [ g/(cm 2 s mol) ], do is initial density of the reacting grain [g/cm3], ro is initial radius of the spherical grain [ cm], co is concentration of the reducing agent in the gaseous phase [ mol/cm3], Ceq is concentration of the reducing agent inside the grain if a hypothetical equilibrium is established at the oxide/metal interface [mol/cm3]. The reader will probably note that the meaning of parameters kd and Ceq is somewhat obscure here. 4.1.1.2. The improved SR equation. Recently, diffusion of water vapour through the ash layer was taken into account. The derivation of the model was changed. Now it is based on clearly presented Spitzer-Manning-Philbrook formalism (SMP) [ 29]. The assumption of the first-order, reversible reaction at the iron/oxide interface has been retained. The new A. Barahski et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 112 (1994) 13-36 derivation method resulted in the equation formally identical to the original one (Eq. 4) but with different physical parameters included into the coefficients M and N of the equation. New coefficients are lacking subscripts SR and are defined as follows: M= R~TcoxXo (7) kr(p ~A b) --p~b) K~-') N= R~TcoxXo (8) t~(p~ ~) -p~)K~- ') O eff rleff I-\" A J~'B axe (9) ~ = D eAff + D ~3ff Ke where: Cox is the concentration of removable oxygen in the catalyst grain [ mol/cm3], D~ f is the effective diffusion coefficient of substrate A [cm2/s], D~ ff is the effective diffusion coefficient of product B [cm 2/s ], kr is the rate constant (parameter of the equation) [ cm/ s ], Ke is the equilibrium constant of the chemical reaction on the interface, p (A b) i S the partial pressure of substrate A [atm], p~b) is the partial pressure of product B [atm], R is the reduction degree, Rg is the gas constant [ (cm 3 atm)/(mol K) ], t is the reaction time [s], T is the absolute temperature [ K], Xo is the initial grain radius [cm]. Only the improved version of the SR model will be discussed in the further text. 4.1.1.3. Langmuir-Hinshelwood version of the SMP formalism. In this version of the SCM model, presented in ref. [ 30] a validity of the Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic equation at the core/ash interface is assumed. The equation contains two parameters, the rate constant (kr) and the equilibrium constant of water adsorption at the interface (K~2. These are the only parameters of the model, although a mixed-control equation is used again because the internal diffusion phenomena can only be characterized by independent porosimetric measurements and by the value of the labyrinth factor. The acronym SMP will be used for this model throughout the paper. 4.1.2. Crackling core model This model, abbreviated CCM, was proposed by Park and Levenspiel in 1975 [ 31] and comprehensively presented in the recent textbook [ 32]. The model is adequate for grains which start as non-porous but become porous on reaction. The original grain crackles and fractures to form an assembly of subgrains. The core of the grain shrinks as the crackling front progresses inward. Each subgrain reacts further according to the SCM. This is why the CCM can be also called \"double SCM model\". No diffusion resistance between the subgrains is assumed. The reaction of subgrains can be limited either by chemical reaction at the interface or by diffusion phenomena inside subgrains, and, therefore, two versions of CCM are available. It implies that the concept of a mixed-control equation has not been applied here. According to the CCM, a system is characterized by two parameters. These are: the time of crackling (%) and the time of a subgrain consumption (rg). In the limiting cases, when the crackling process is extremely fast and % = 0, the CCM model turns into the SCM model. A. Barahski et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 112 (1994) 13-36 4.1.3. Parabolic equation The equation takes the form R = 100.kt n (10) where k and n are parameters. The value of n is close to 0.5. The derivation of the equation is based, among others, on the assumption that diffusion of a reagent through a homogeneous layer determines the reaction rate. The equation was used in 1992 for description of the kinetic data obtained in wet atmosphere [ 33 ]. When the temperature of reduction decreases, the equation fits the data better [ 12]. 4.2. Data processing procedures 4.2.1. Linearization method The method was applied in an earlier paper [9]. The Eq. (4) was linearized: ( 6 ) Y-1 R (l_R)2/3-M .l+(l_R)l/3_2(l_R)2/3 +N=MX+N (11) 2 3 2 Substitution of the symbols MsR = M and NsR = N should be remembered. Subsequently, the empirical coefficients M and Nas well as the parameters kr and/3 were calculated from the slope and intercept of the straight line Y= MX + N and from definitions (7) and (8). Linearization can also be helpful in the case of the CCM model and parabolic equation; however, this procedure was never applied. 4.2.2. The criticism of linearization Linearization makes calculations and the visual interpretation of the data very easy. This is why it is preferred. But very often the users of the method forget that in the case of nonlinear transformations of coordinates the solution of the resulting linear regression problem does not correspond to the minimum of the sum of squares of the residuals in the original system of coordinates. Unfortunately, some of the popular handbooks on statistics [34] lull readers into belief that this fact is of no great importance. But at least some nonlinear transformations of coordinates imply a necessity of using weighted linear regression [35], and this, in turn, implies a necessity of transforming statistical weights* too. The reader can find an example of kinetic data plotted both in natural (R vs. t) and linearized coordinates in Fig. 8. Careful analysis, performed recently, of many of our kinetic plots (both experimental and calculated) in linearized as well as in natural coordinates revealed an existence of some regularities. (a) The experimental points equally distributed in the natural system of coordinates (Fig. 8a) tend to converge at the lower left corner of *Let us recall that statistical weights are defined as the reciprocals of variances of the dependent variable (e.g. the reduction degree) obtained from repeated experiments (kinetic runs).

Exemplary kinetic data (catalyst 4, 500, dry atmosphere) plotted in the natural (a) and linearized (b, c, d) system of coordinates. The marked parts of the plots (b) and (c) correspond to the subsequent subfigures. The linearized coordinates of plots (b), (c) and (d) are defined by the Eq. ( 11 ). the linearized system** (more than a half of them fits into 1% of the whole X-range defined by Eq. (11), see Fig. 8d). (b) In the initial stages of reduction (points corresponding to the upper right part of Fig. 8b), even the slightest departure of an experimental point from the calculated curve is grossly exaggerated on the linearized plot. Both these observations cannot be directly deduced from the linearized Eq. ( 11 ) but they have a grave consequence --the initial points of a kinetic curve tend to determine the slope and intercept of the theoretical straight line. Of course, this would not be the case if the statistical weights, based on significant amounts of repeated kinetic runs, were rigorously taken into account. 4.2.3. Nonlinear regression procedures Let us note that, in contrast to the natural experimental set of coordinates R =f(t), the kinetic Eq. (4) reveals a form of reverse t=f(R) relationship. The Eq. (4) cannot be algebraically transformed into an R =f(t) dependence. This is why the nonlinear Eq. (4) was solved numerically. The method applied here was an old and slow but always reliable bisection method. Anyway, the computation times on an IBM 386 microcomputer with coprocessor were of the order of a few seconds. **Spitzer et al. [ 29 ] report a similar behaviour of kinetic plots in which [ 1 - ( 1 -R) ~/31 is plotted against time, but in our case deformations of the natural system of coordinates occur on much larger scale. A. Baradski et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 112 (1994) 13-36 Then the sum of squares of differences between the experimental and calculated values of the reduction degree was minimized. For this purpose, a suite of computer programs was designed. The unified format of the experimental data files, interactive graphical interface and possibility of obtaining information about the reduction degree as well as the shrinking core radius changes in time make this programs a powerful tool for kinetic data interpreta- tion. The numerical procedures applied in the programs consisted of a direct solution of nonlinear equations connected with the application of the minimization methods. Monte Carlo, simplex and an \"intelligent\" grid-search method with a variable minimization step proved to be quite adequate for these calculations. Application of gradient methods was not necessary because the calculation times, even on an IBM XT computer, were less than a few minutes. An optimal choice of the starting point for calculations was another problem, especially in the program for SCM calculations. In order to avoid waste of time in the case of a totally inadequate starting point, a possibility of monitoring and breaking calculations at any time was incorporated into the minimization subroutines. Finally let us outline the reasons why, in the case of the SR model, we decided to apply the natural set of coordinates in our present calculations instead of introducing the statistical weights into the linearized equation. After all, the linear regression calculations are much faster than the procedures of minimization and solving nonlinear equations. Firstly, the reader should be aware that in the natural system of coordinates the reduction time is a virtually errorless quantity*, the only uncertainty is connected with the measured reduction degree. In the linearized system, on the other hand, both X and Y coordinates are uncertain, as they are the functions of R. This greatly complicates the calculation procedure of the statistical weights and the linear regression itself. Secondly, a considerable concentration of points with large statistical weights occurs in a very tiny part of the whole picture, whereas only a few points with small statistical weights occupy most of the plot area. The deformation introduced by this phenomenon into our linearized system would yield an artificial \"discrepancy\" between the experimental points and the correctly calculated straight line, very misleading to the eye. Last but not least, it is much easier to compare the results of calculations for various kinetic models if all the kinetic curves are presented in the same system of natural coordinates R =f(t). 5. Results and discussion concerning the industrial catalyst This paper is based on new data as well as on reinterpreted ones, published previously in [9,30,36]. Every experimental kinetic curve is based on a number of individual kinetic runs; the extreme cases are two and ten. 5.1. Comparison of kinetic models: superiority of the SR model Three kinetic models valid at dry atmosphere have been compared using reduction data of catalyst 4. These are: SR, SMP and CCM. *The absolute error of the reduction time measurements is almost negligible, but uncertainty of measuring the starting time of the reduction process ho~s to be taken into account. Fortunately, this merely results in shifting all points in the same way. 28 A.

The comparison of fitting three kinetic models to the data obtained for catalyst 4 at 500 in dry atmosphere. The differences between experimental and calculated points are also given in the enlarged scale. The values of residual standard deviations (r.st.d.) are indicated directly in the figure. Typical results of fitting these kinetic models to experimental data can be seen in Fig. 9, where not only kinetic curves but also differences between calculated and experimental values are shown in the enlarged scale. These results were obtained for catalyst 4 reduced at 500 in dry atmosphere, but other catalysts reduced at other temperatures yielded a very similar picture. The SR model results in the best fit, and the SMP model is somewhat worse. The crackling- core model is evidently not adequate here. A sigmoidal shape of the calculated kinetic curve can be easily observed [37 ]. This sigmoidal shape of a theoretical CCM curve is inherent in the mathematical equations of the model, and the scale of this inflection depends on the ratio of crackling (~-c) and reduction (~'g) times only. In the boundary case of %--0, the sigmoidal shape disappears totally and the crackling core model becomes a simple core- and-shell model. Above 450 our experimental data do not reveal any inflection points, and, therefore, the CCM cannot describe the reduction process of the catalyst properly. A. Barahski et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 112 (1994) 13-36 5.2. Validity of the SR model at the beginning of the reduction It is seen from Fig. 9 that the SR model fits the data from the very beginning of the reduction. Comparison of the results obtained by linearization and nonlinear regression evidences that the latter method always results in a better fit, even though points from the beginning of the reduction curve are present in the data set. It is obvious that the lower boundary of the validity of Seth-Ross equation [9] was a consequence of transformation of the original system of coordinates. 5.3. The meaning of the parameters of the Seth-Ross equation Pore distribution data obtained within the temperature range 450-550 for KMI catalyst (catalyst 4) have been reported in an earlier paper [ 30]. Effective diffusivities of hydrogen and water were calculated from the data, as shown by Arrhenius plots in Fig. 4 of the above mentioned paper. Both plots are almost parallel, and, hence, the ratio of effective diffusiv- ities: D eff H2 Deft = \"/ (12) H20 is independent of temperature. The value of y amounts to ca. 2.50. Introducing y into the definition of/3 (Eq. 9) yields Deft _ ]~('Yq-ge) (13) H20 Ke Thus, the effective diffusivity can be calculated directly from the kinetic parameter/3. Calculations performed for various temperatures yielded an Arrhenius plot and activation energy of 32.2 _ 2.8 kcal/mol. This is in contrast to the value of 4 or 2 kcal/mol determined from the porosimetric data. This discrepancy shows that the parameter/3 has no physico- chemical meaning and even the modified Seth-Ross equation is only an empirical relation. 5.4. Reduction of different industrial catalysts and the usefulness of the SR model The results of fitting the Seth-Ross equation to kinetic data of the reduction of four industrial catalysts at 500 are given in Fig. 10. It is seen from this figure that the Seth- Ross model fits the presented data in the same way. 5.5. Applicability of the SR model to wet atmosphere activation The Seth-Ross equation was applied for the description of wet atmosphere activation. The most essential kinetic data are shown in Table 2. For the sake of comparison, the data concerning reduction in dry atmosphere are presented as well. At the lowest temperature of 450 and in wet atmosphere, the kinetic parameters attained unrealistic values. As was already pointed out [ 12], at these conditions the parabolic law fits the data well. This is why further discussion will be limited to the temperatures 500 and 550. A.

Barahski et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 112 (1994) 13-36 The applicability of the SR equation in wet atmosphere is roughly 2-3 times worse than that for dry atmosphere. The rate constants differ by a factor varying from 0.3 to 1.3 and, on average, are smaller. The values of parameter/3 reveal more essential differences. In wet atmosphere, at 550 and at 500, they are 7 and 70 times smaller, respectively. It was previously concluded --in dry atmosphere at least -- that the parameter/3 lacks a physicochemical meaning. Additionally, the porosimetric spectra obtained at dry and wet atmospheres did not reveal significant differences [ 38]. In this situation further speculative discussion aimed at explaining the physicochemical meaning of the D elf parameters in both atmospheres seems to be unjustified and the conclusion concerning an empirical nature of the SR equation is convincingly confirmed. 6. Concluding remarks Our kinetic experiments were carried out mainly in dry and wet atmospheres containing 102 and l0 4 ppm of water, respectively. Less frequently the water content amounted to 6000 ppm. As pointed out by Schl~gl [6], the reduction in dry atmosphere \"Corresponds to near- optimal conditions\" existing in the circulating gas returning to the converter. According to Hooper [4], in the converter the \"exit water concentration of 5000 ppm is a good operating limit and 10 000 ppm should be regarded as a maximum\". Thus dry and wet atmospheres correspond to properly chosen extremal conditions of the reduction. The kinetics of reduction of the industrial catalysts and some selected model catalysts is quite similar. The Seth-Ross equation fits the data well in both cases. Obviously, the composition of the model catalyst in question has to be comparable to the industrial ones, and, in this respect, the promotion by alumina is the most important feature. The typical examples of model catalysts meeting these requirements are Alcatl-M and AlKcatl-6. On the other hand, the composition of the unpromoted catalyst and another catalyst containing large amounts of wustite (Alcatl-95) differs too much from the industrial ones, and these catalysts are reduced differently. Four equations were tried in order to describe kinetic data. These were: SR, SMP, CCM and parabolic equation. The details concerning application of these equations to our kinetic data are given below. 6.1. The modified Seth-Ross equation In dry atmosphere, the SR equation fits the kinetic data excellently. In wet atmosphere the fitting is worse but may be acceptable. The equation is only an empirical relation because: --The energy of activation of the effective diffusivity calculated solely from the kinetic data amounts to the unreasonable value close to 30 kcal/mol. --The kinetic parameters obtained from dry and wet kinetic data reveal significant differences. Nevertheless, for practical purposes (e.g. technological design) one can try to calibrate the parameters of SR equation versus the water content in the gas phase. A. Bara~ski et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 112 (1994) 13-36 6.2. The Langmuir-Hinshelwood version of the SMP formalism In dry atmosphere the SMP formalism, when applied to the kinetic data obtained for reduction of an industrial catalyst has physicochemical meaning, as explained previously [ 30]. The fit of the SMP equation is somewhat worse in comparison to SR. The case when the empirical relation fits experimental data better than the equations with the physicochem- ical meaning was discussed by Pearson [39]. The fitting of the SMP formalism to wet atmosphere data is poor (r.std.dev ~ 2%). The parameters of the equations are different by several orders of magnitude from the values obtained in dry atmosphere. The applicability of SMP in the case of model catalysts is inconvenient because an independent information concerning effective diffusivities is needed. And, finally, the SMP equation is far more complicated than the SR model. These are the reasons why SR is preferred over SMP. 6.3. The retardation effect of water and the ' 'parabolic\" equation A small amount of water vapour in the reducing gas (ca. 6-10 thousands of ppm) drastically decreases the reduction rate. For simplicity, the phenomenon will be called the water effect or even the effect only. Studying this effect is difficult because the catalyst is a multicomponent and multiphase system [8], especially in the transient state during the activation. This turned our attention to model catalysts. The general idea was to simplify the system and to see whether or not the effect was enhanced. Let us remember that this methodology was applied by M. & P. Curie in order to extract radium from uranium ore. In our studies concerning activation of the catalyst it has been subsequently revealed that: (i) promoters [13], (ii) alumina [14], and (iii) alumina in magnetite matrix [11] are responsible for the water effect. It was also found that the effect was reversible [40] and depended on temperature. At higher temperatures the effect was weaker [ 12]. The retardation effect is prevented by a increased amount of wustite and potassium. A full explanation of the effect (in the molecular scale) is not available yet. However, the reversibility of the effect leads to the scheme (Fig. 11) of hydrated and dehydrated surfaces, similar to the concept of Machej et al. [41 ]. The dehydrated surface can be easily reduced, whereas the reduction of a hydrated surface is very difficult. Obviously, identifi- Water content in the gas phase Hydrated catalyst surface 10 4 ppm 10 2 ppm Dehydrated catalyst surface ) slow reduction fast reduction Fig. 11.

Hypothetical inhibiting, Al-rich, surface layer containing inclusions of wustite; m denotes magnetite, w stands for wustite, and i corresponds to iron obtained from wustite at the very beginning of reduction. cation of the hydrated and dehydrated surface species is of utmost importance. According to the hypothesis by Schl~3gl [6] the hydrated surface is covered by a dense layer of aluminium oxohydroxides. In the dry atmosphere the parabolic equation is significantly less adequate than the SR model. The greater water content in the gas phase and the lower temperature make the fit of the parabolic law to kinetic data better [ 12]. Finally, at 450 in wet atmosphere, for the industrial catalyst the parabolic relation is even superior to SR. At these extreme conditions the reduction rate is considerably retarded by water vapour. Perhaps the hypotheses Of hydration and of inhibiting surface layer [6,33,40] will be useful in further studies aimed at better understanding of the water effect and the real meaning of the parabolic equation as applied to the problem in question. For example, the effect of wustite can be explained under the rather obvious assumption that the inhibiting layer is not formed on the surface of wustite. If the wustite content is high enough, its clusters form discontinuities in the inhibiting layer covering the solid catalyst, thus enabling diffusion of the reducing gas into the bulk of the catalyst (Fig. 12). The effect of potassium can be explained by the formation of a compound with AI20 3 [42]. The compound competes on the surface with the inhibiting layer and/or decreases the amount of alumina available for its formation. Further experimental evidence is of course required in order to prove the hypotheses outlined above. 6.4. The crackling-core model The Park and Levenspiel model [ 31 ] is the last one left for discussion. Adequacy of the CCM is backed up by a variety of data. Porosimetric spectra reveal two maxima [38]. At the beginning of reduction R < 10%, broader 30 nm pores are the dominating ones. The reverse is true at the end of reduction when more narrow 10 nm pores are the most abundant ones. The types of pores can be linked to the crackling phenomenon and to the process of consumption of subgrains, respectively. The most comprehensive studies of the mechanism of the catalyst activation were done by Schl6gl [6]. Among other techniques, he monitored the reduction process by X-ray A. Barariski et aL /Applied Catalysis A: General 112 (1994) 13-36 diffraction. It was found that \"particle size of the o~-iron product is significantly smaller than that of parent magnetite\". Although this is not a conclusive proof, the above opinion strongly favours the CCM model. Low magnification microscopy studies [43] directly show that in wet atmosphere SCM is not valid, and the internal type of reduction is visible. This supports the CCM mechanism. Taking the facts outlined above into account one can ask why SCM fits kinetic data excellently and CCM fails. Tracing back through the literature yields the answer. Twenty years ago Chen and Anderson [44] described unreduced catalyst as being composed of magnetite grains sur- rounded by slag-like envelopes. \"The reduction starts at the periphery of a particle and proceeds inward along the envelopes\". These observations correspond well with the CCM model. In order to explain the kinetics of activation in a quantitative way, let us recall that when the crackling process is fast there is no inflection point on the kinetic curve and CCM turns into SCM. Then the value of the characteristic dimension is the only difference between both models. Radii of the reduced subgrains are much smaller (as a result of crackling) than the initial grain radius. However, the value of the radius is hidden in the experimental coefficients M and N of Eq. ( 11 ), and, therefore, when crackling is very fast, CCM and SCM cannot be distinguished with the use of kinetic data only. One can assume that very fast crackling may be caused by an interaction of water vapour with the glassy slag-like envelopes of the unreduced catalyst. This is why internal reduction was observed during the activation of the iron catalyst in wet atmosphere [43 ]. 7. Research prospects Knowledge concerning the simultaneous effect of total pressure and water vapour is essential for the purposes of technological design. This is a difficult task, and, hence, a new experimental approach would be useful. The effect of pressure (0.1-4 MPa) has been studied, up to now [45], only at low water contents (700-1700 ppm). The range of 0.5- 1.5 MPa is of particular importance for the production of a prereduced catalyst. Every reaction in the solid-gas system involves nucleation problems. As was pointed out by Schl6gl, the disproportionation of wustite is the source of iron nuclei [6]. This is why the disproportionation processes have been studied recently by Pattek-Janczyk [46], and an attempt to explain the function of wustite in the catalyst has been undertaken [47]. The aim of reduction is to get an active catalyst. A need of data that link the way of reduction and the catalyst properties -- especially the activity -- was strongly emphasized by the referee of this paper. The reader should be reminded that a single paper revealing the beneficial effect of the polythermic way of reduction has already been published by us many years ago [48].

The paper summarizes our results published for many years and also adds new information. Kinetic data concerning the reduction of the oxidized forms of model as well as industrial catalysts used in ammonia synthesis were obtained in dry and in wet atmosphere containing 1% water vapour. The data for the industrial catalyst have been reassessed using three kinetic models. Modifications applied to the classical Seth-Ross model of the shrinking-core type resulted in the best fitting of this equation to the experimental data. The failure of the crackling core model to describe the kinetic data in a quantitative way is tentatively explained. The reduction of model catalysts containing enhanced amounts of wustite and/or potassium proceeds initially linearly with time. The effect of promoters, and especially of potassium, is discussed in more detail. The magnetite-alumina subsystem is responsible for the retardation effect of the water vapour on the reduction rate. A hypothesis is formulated that — in the presence of wustite or potassium — the inhibitive, Al-rich, hydrated surface layer is not effective in hindering the progress of the reduction process.
