The Netherlands IMMOBILIZI,TION OF A HOMOGENEOUS MACROMOLEGULAR COPPER CAT'ALYST FOR THE OXIDATIVE COUPLING OF PHENOLS* J. P. J. VERLAAN, J. P. C. BOOTSMA and G. CHALLA Laboratory oPolymer Chemistry. State University of Groningen, N(jersborg 16. 9747 AG Groningen (The Netherlands) (Received May 20, 1981) Summary In order to combine the advantages of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, an immobilized macromolecular copper catalyst was prepared by radical graft copolymerization of styrene and 4 vinylpyridine on nonporous silica spheres and by subsequent complex formation of copper(II) chloride With these grafted macromolecular pyridine ligands. The oxidative coupling of 2,6-.isubsiituted phenols was chosen to test. the catalytically active species, i.e. dihydrogo-bridged copper dieters. The immobilized polymeric catalysts show a remarkable activity: reaction rates up to 7090 compared to nonbound macromolecular analogues can be achieved. Moreover, they can easily be re-used several times without loss of activity, while the mechanism of the coupling reaction is not influenced. Introduction Oxidative coupling of phenols catalyzed by a large variety of copper salts has been a subject of continuous interest- _The utilization of homogeneous linear polymer-copper catalysts (a) showed some specific activity effect [1] . All preceding investigations have dealt with dissolved catalytic systems. Subsequent.separaiion of catalyst and products is a very laborious and time-consuming process, sometimes even impossible. The problem was solved for this investigation by attaching these homogeneous linear macromolecular catalysts to an inert support (bj. Ea) *Odicated to Prof. G. Manecke on the occasion of his 65th. birthday. 212 In order to obtain such an immobilized macromolecular catalyst, a radical initiator bound to nonporous silica spheres was synthesized, following the procedure of Fery and co-workers [2] . This radical initiator was employed to start copolymerization, and resulted in immobilized macromolecular amines for complexation of the copper salt. The unbound copper complexes of copolymers of 4-vinylpyridine and styrene (c) (a = mole fraction of 4 vinylpyridine units in the copolymer) are more active in oxidative coupling reactions than the corresponding low molecular weight pyridine analogue [1] . CH2 H ~~ co ---(- CH2_ CH -)a.- z o~ XL L ('~ON CU y,/ \\\" L -l H (C) (d) It has been shown that the active catalytic species in this system consists of dihydroxo-bridged binuclear copper(II) complexes (d) [3] . These active complexes O be prepared starrting either from CuCI in the presence of dioxygen and water or from CuC12-2H20 and sodium hydroxide. By using 2,6-lisubstituted phenols as substrate, only two kinds of coupling products are obtained [4] . Depending on reaction conditions, catalyst composition, substituent R (Scheme 1), C-0 and/or C-C coupling occurs, yielding 2,6-.isubstituted polyphenylane oxide (PPO)* and/or tetra-substituted diphenoquinones (DPQ)** [5] .

The fraction (a) of 4-vinylpyridine units in the copolymer was determined by elemental analysis (C f Fl f 1V > 99ss'o). Silica-bound radical initiator The radical initiator ached to silica (Aerosil 200V, Degussa) was synthesized according to Fery, Laible and Hamann [2]. & oHb . cl,si-CHz~NoZ _, sio~ 0~i-CHZ~N=re-x o- 0 H fIl p-Nitrobenzyltrichlorosilane was coupled to the hydroxo groups an the surface of the nonporous silica spheres. The nitro groups could be transferred after reduction and diazotization in the radical initiator, (1), where X = pthionaphtholate. The sulphur content was 0.03ss'o by weight (elemental analysis), corresponding to 0.01 mmol initiator/gram silica. The yellow Lzitiator vans stored at =20 C and used within a few days after synthesis. Grafting of at polystyrene-co-4-ainylpyridine on silica The monomers were distizled under reduced nitrogen pressure and subsequently copolymerized in bulk with the silica-bound radical initiator under nitrogen for 20 h, while the re,-.coon mixture was continuously stirred in a thermostatted bath at 60 *C. ~ioZ 0.s!-CHZ~CHZ-CHIECOZCHZ-CHl.

The degree of loading of the silica spheres, 8 (weight fraction of bound copolymer), was determined by elemental analysis (C, f N and loss on ignition).. The degree of functionalization, a, O derived from elemental analysis of the unbound copolymer assuming that a of (11) is equal to a of (11I). Remount of unbound copolymer To remove physically adsorbed copolymer, the silica-bound copolymer was suspended in a 1,2-dichlorobenzene/methanol (13/2, v v) mixture. After 214 15 min of vigorous shaking, the silica spheres were allowed to settle and the solvent mixture was decanted. This procedure was performed 3 times. Then the grafted silica. spheres were filtered, washed and Soxhlet extracted with acetone for 8 h. Finally, they were dried in vacuum (for elemental analysis see Table 1). Oxidative coupling reactions The active catalytic complex (d) was prepared by dissolution (or suspension) of the (iinmohilized) copolymer in a mixture of 1,2-dichlorobenzene and methanol. 4fter adding CuClz- 2H20, a standard solution of methanol sodium hydroxide was aided. The total reaction mixture was shaken and saturated with dioxygen in a thermostatted bath. After addition of substrate (phenol) the dioxygen consumption rate was measured with an automatic gas burette under constant diogygen pressure. The following standard conditions were chosen: total reaction volume 0.015 dm3; T = 298.16 K; solvent mixture 1,2-iichlorobenzene: methanol = 13:2 (v/v); [Cue'] = 3.32 mmol. dm 3; [phenol] = 0.06 mol. dm 3; [pyridine] : [Cu21] = 2: [OH-1 = [Cu21] = 1; Po= = 101.3 kPa. Re-use of the immobilized catalyst At the end of the coupling reaction (over 9590 conversion of phenol, as determined by the total aioxygen consumption) the shaking of the reaction vessel was stopped and the immobilized catalyst was allowed to settle for more than 1 h. The supernatant liquid with the products was decanted and if necessary centrifuged to restrict loss of non-settled catalyst. Then a fresh solvent mixture was added to the gel-like catalyst and the mixture was saturated with dioxygen. Vigorous shaking was necessary to disperse the catalyst again. New substrate was added and the dioxygen consumption rate was measured again. This procedure was repeated several times. Results and discussion Figure 1 chows that the dihydroxo-bridged copper complexes of unbound copolymers of styrene and 4-vinylpyridine (d) can be used as catalysts for the oxidative coupling of several 2,6-disubstituted phenols (Scheme 1). The activities were measured under standard conditions for different substrates as a function of the pyridine content, a, in the copolymers. With R = methyl (DMP), a much higher activity is observed than for R = phenyl (DPP) or R = tert-butyl (DTBP). This can partly be attributed to the smaller size of the methyl group. The reaction rate of DiIIP coupling increases with increasing a, which indicates that the polymer chain itself can play an active role in the reaction course [1] . . When DPP or DTBP is used only a very small increase oactivity with increasing a is observed. Due to steric hindrance of the bulky tert-butyl groups of DTBP only C--C coupling can occur, consequently DPQ is exclu- 215 TABLE 1 Data on immobilized and unbound copolymersa, [OIy-(CH2CHCG H-- )Z -a-ca-(CH?CHCr.H N)a rB - [Sio2 ) 1 -e Sample - - Elemental Analyses _ (k 19b %C 9oE-1 %aN %Sioz a) immobilized copolymer 18.13 1.76 1.14 78.04 0.23c 0.19 b) unbound copolymer 86.52 7.34 2.99 2.1 0.23 - a) immobilized copolymer 14.30 1.46 n.d. 81.39 0.25 0.15 b) recycled after being 7.64 0.98 n.d. 8ol85 0.25 0.07 used 10 times imraobilizpd aced 35.77 3.13 n.d. 58.55 0.25 0.38 extracted copolymer unbound copolymer 89.77 7.64 2.50 0 0.19 - unbound copolymer 88.20 7.84 3.66 0 0.27 - mole fraction; 8 = weight fraction. ba small correction was applied for residua! organic material (see text). derived from simultaneously formed unbound copolymer. v E C .0 0 16 0 0.1 02 03 Q Fig. 1.

When R = phenyl both DPQ and PPO are formed, but DPQ is sill the major product. Finally, PPO is predominantly formed. when DMP is used as a substrate. In all experiments diogygen was completely reduced to water, as was established by measuring the total amount of dioxygen consumption after ccmpietion of the reaction. 216 Since we a=-e mainly interested in effects related to immobilization of macromolecular catalysts, DTBP was first chosen as a substrate. This substrate has t-he advantage of yielding only one soluble reaction product, DPQ, with catalytic activities that are nearly insensitive to fluctuations in a (see Fig. 1). In pAnciple there are two methods to attach polymers to a support [7] . One can synthesize polymers bearing reactive end groups that can couple to the support, or one can create groups that can initiate polymerization of suitable monomers on the support itself. The second method was chosen since it allows better regulation of the degree of loading of the support over a wider range of 0 values [8] . Silica was chosen as a support because of its high density, chemical inertness and nonporosity compared w;th other support-materials. In 1 able 1 elemental analyses of several immobilized and unbound copolymers are listed. For the immobilized copolymers it wns attempted to fig a around 0.25. The degree of loading, 0 , was corrected for the percentage of non-initiating organic material originating from the synthetic procedure. In order to discover whether it is possible to convert these immobilized copolymers into catalytically active copper complexes, comparative experiments were performed, using immobilized and unbound copolymers. It was already known that copper complexes were optimally active for DMP coupling when [O H`] : [Cu\"] = I [3] . Therefore the activities for DTBP coupling were measured as a function of hydrogo content in the copper complexes for both types oa copolymers. In both cases (Fig. 2), optimal activity is reached when [OH-]: [Cue+] = I, which points to the same catalytically active species as before [3] . However, at [OH-] : [Cu 2+1 = 1 the activity of immobilized catalyst is nearly half t-he activity of unbound catalyst. i o gain information on the loss in activity of the immobilized catalyst, measurements were perform jd as a function of substrate concentration. A double reciprocal plot of ini-dal reaction rate R, versus concentration [S] , for unbound and immobilized catalyst, resulted in straight lines with common ordinate intercepts (Fig. 3) indicating a Michaelis-Menten type of reaction scheme for bound and unbound catalysts.

From the slope of the Lineweaver-Burk plots the ivfichaelis constant Km = (k_1 + k2)jkj. can be derived: Km = 0.5 mol. dm-3 for unbound catalyst and If. = 1.1 mol. dm-3 for immobilized catalyst.

Standard reaction conditions, varying [DTBP]. equilibrium constant R1. = ki/k-,_. Obviously, the decrease in the reaction rate after immobilization is mainly caused by a decrease in the concentration of Michaelis-Menten complex ES. Thus immobilization does not affect the intrinsic activity of the catalytic sites. The first target of immobilization is re-use by easy separation of the catalyst [9]. Since the catalyst is immobilized on silica with a fairly high specific density of 2.2 g cm-3 it will rapidly settle in most organic liquids. After decantation (see experimental), new solvent and substrate were added and the activitv was measured again. The reaction rates obtained with an untreated sample of the catalyst are shown in Fig. 4 (e). It can be shown that the initial drop in activity from 5.9 to 2.7 X 10' mol dO-3 s ' was simply caused by loss of catalyst. r being used ten times, the grafted polymer was isolated, freed from copper, purified and analyzed. The degree of loading, 9 , appeared to have decreased from the initial value of 0.15 to 0.07, which is in agreement with the loss of activity. Fn case of exhaustive pretreatment of the bound copolymer with solvent mixture (see experimental), physically adsorbed polymer could be completely removed and even after repeated usage no decrease in activity was observed. This indicates that art initial drop in activity O be attributed to loss of physically adsorbed copolymer rather than to detachment of originally taund copolymer. The observed constant activity of the pretreated immeb liized catalyst (under standard conditions) was 7070 of the value for unbound macromoiecular catalyst (i.e. 4.7 versus 7.0 X 10-6 mol dm 3 s-f ). The ini dal increase in catalytic activity is reproducible and might be caused 218 Fig. a. Reaction rates R, is subsequent usages of immobilized polymer catalysts.

This phenomenon deserves further study. Conclusions From our investigation it is obvious that immobilization of a polymer catalyst en nonporous silica spheres leads to encouraging results: (i) the chemically buuad polymeric ligands for metal complexation are not removed frown the silica support; (ii) in 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol coupling, the activity oimmobilized catalyst under standard conditions is up to 7090 of the value of the unbound polymeric analogue; (iii) the reaction mechanism (Michaelis-Menten kinetics) is not affected by immobilization of the homogeneous polymeric catalyst; (iv) the intrinsic activity othe catalytic sites is not affected; (v) the steady-slate concentration of catalyst-substrate complex decreases, as was shown by an increasing Michaelis constant, K,,,, for the immobilized catalyst; (vi) separation of catalyst and products can easily be done; (vii) multiple usage othe immobilized catalyst is possible in a batchtype reactor; (viii) maintenance of catalytic activity after repeated usage is warranted.
