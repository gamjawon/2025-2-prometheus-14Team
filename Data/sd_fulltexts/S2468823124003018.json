Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to formic acid is a much-anticipated way of converting excess CO2 to high-value-added products. Bismuth (Bi)-based materials are promising catalysts, but remain challenging in terms of activity and selectivity. Herein, we reported a composition manipulation strategy to achieve simultaneous high activity and selectivity for CO2RR towards formate by incorporating Lewis acid Cr2O3 into Bi. Specifically, a novel Bi-Cr2O3 crystalline-amorphous catalyst was prepared by electroreduction of bismuth chromate (Bi2(CrO4)3). The as-prepared catalyst shows nano-dendrites structure, promising the maximum exposure of active sites. The obtained Bi-Cr2O3 catalyst exhibits a high Faradic efficiency (FEformate, 93.3 %) at −1.1 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and can achieve a remarkable current density of −40.7 mA cm−2 at the same potential. Meanwhile, the FEformate remains above 90 % over a wide potential window (−0.8 ∼ −1.2 V vs RHE) and the stability can maintain for 13 h at −0.9 V vs RHE with high selectivity (>90 %) and stable physical phase. Furthermore, the Zn-CO2 battery assembled with a Bi-Cr2O3 catalyst achieves the greatest power density of 4.63 mW cm−2 and could maintain cyclic charge/discharge stability for 40 h.

Introduction The rapid consumption of chemical fuels has led to energy shortages, while the excessive emission of CO2 has created serious environmental problems [1,2]. Electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CO2RR) to high value-added carbon products offers a promising method to alleviate the crisis of the increasing CO2 concentration, and its coupled application with renewable sources also provides an appealing energy conversion technology [3–5]. Recently, this technology has also attracted widespread attention as a cathode reaction for metal-CO2 batteries, which can simultaneously fulfill the energy storage and CO2 conversion without any electricity input [6]. Among the various carbon products, formate/formic served as an industrial intermediate and hydrogen carrier has attracted much attention [7,8]. However, the application of CO2RR to formate is greatly restricted by the sluggish kinetics and relatively low selectivity due to the thermodynamic stability of CO2 molecules and the inevitable competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and other competing C1 or C2 product [9–12]. Therefore, exploring electrocatalysts with excellent activity and formate selectivity is highly desirable. To date, many metal-based catalysts such as Sn, In, Bi, Hg, Cd, and Pb have shown great potential for efficient CO2RR to formate [13–18]. Among these, Bi has been considered as the most promising catalyst because of its high abundance, low toxicity, and slow kinetic activity of HER [19–21]. As a result, various Bi-based materials like Bi-MOF, BiPO4, and BiOI have been developed for CO2RR [22–24]. However, most Bi-based catalysts usually only achieve low catalytic current densities or require high overpotentials, and the presence of competing products (H2, CO) limits the application of the catalysts. In respond to these, various strategies have been employed to enhance the performance of Bi-based catalysts, such as increasing the surface area by adjusting the morphology or modifying the electronic structure of Bi by doping or interface engineering to improve the activity [25–27]. But in general view, the activity and selectivity of electrocatalytic CO2 to formate still need to be improved due to the high overpotential and serious hydrogen evolution. According to the current understanding of the reaction mechanism of CO2RR to formate, the adsorption and activation of CO2 can process two different routes, that is O-linked pathway and C-linked pathway [28]. The first is to bond the O atom of the CO2 molecule to the active site (*) via the electron transfer process to form a *CO2 − radical, then to form the *OCHO intermediate through proton transfer, and finally to produce formate. The second is to link the C atom of the CO2 molecule to obtain protons and electrons at the same time via concerted proton-electron transfer (CPET, * + CO2 + H+ + e − → *COOH) to directly form the *COOH intermediate, which continues to obtain protons and electrons to generate formate [29]. Generally, the formed *COOH via the C-linked pathway can also produce *CO intermediate, which can further undergo different pathways to yield various products such as CO, CH4, CH3OH, C2H4, and CH3CH2OH. In sharp contrast, the formate is the sole product in the O-linked pathway. Therefore, it can be speculated that the activity and selectivity of the catalyst would be effectively improved by rationally designing the catalyst along the O-linked path. The O atom of CO2 with a lone pair of electrons can be regarded as a Lewis base, which is easily selectively adsorbed by Lewis acids according to the Lewis acid-base adsorption theory [30]. On the other hand, Cr2O3 is well known as a Lewis acid, which has been broadly applied as an anti-corrosion material but still rarely investigated in CO2RR. In this regard, a rational combination of the promising Bi and Lewis acid Cr2O3 is a judicious choice for efficient CO2RR towards formate. Herein, we reported the facile fabrication of a Bi-Cr2O3 crystalline-amorphous catalyst with excellent CO2RR performance to formate. Specifically, the Bi-Cr2O3 catalyst was prepared by electroreduction of the Bi2(CrO4)3 precursors obtained by the co-precipitation method. The as-prepared Bi-Cr2O3 catalyst exhibits a nano-dendrites structure, which also promises the maximum exposure of active sites. Experimental studies revealed that the as-prepared catalyst shows a high Faradaic efficiency for formate (FEformate) in a value of 93.3 % and a high current density of −40.7 mA cm−2 at −1.1 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Moreover, the FEformate remains above 90 % from −0.8 to −1.2 V vs RHE, and the stability is maintained for 13 h at −0.9 V vs RHE without a significant decrease in Faradaic efficiency. In particular, Bi-Cr2O3 could be applied to Zn-CO2 batteries with a peak power density of 4.63 mW cm−2, and the FEformate is consistently greater than 65 % at discharge current densities ranging from 1 to 6 mA cm−2. The assembled Zn-CO2 batteries also presents excellent rechargeable durability with 40 h of continuous operation at 1 mA cm−2. Experimental section Materials Potassium chromate (K2CrO4, 99.5 %), Sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 96 %), Ethanol (CH3CH2OH, 99.5 %), Acetic acid (CH3COOH, 99.5 %), Potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3, 99.5 %), Bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, 99 %), Potassium hydroxide (KOH, 85 %), Commercial bismuth (Bi, 99 %), Nafion solution (5.0 wt%), Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99 %), Potassium formate (KCOOH, 99 %), Zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(AC)2·2H2O, 99.99 %), Carbon paper (Toray TGP-H-060). Synthesis of electrocatalysts Preparation of Bi2(CrO4)3 precursor Bi2(CrO4)3 precursor was prepared via a simple coprecipitation method at room temperature [31]. Typically, 6.36 g Bi(NO3)3·5H2O was put into 100 mL of glacial acetic acid and ultrasonic at room temperature for half an hour. 5.07 g K2CrO4 was dissolved in 100 mL deionized water. Then the K2CrO4 solution was slowly added into the Bi(NO3)3·5H2O solution under mechanical stirring. After reaction for 24 h, the yellow particles were filtered, washed with distilled water several times, and finally dried at 60 °C for 12 h. Preparation of Bi-Cr2O3 nano-dendrites 10 mg of Bi2(CrO4)3 precursor, 40 μL 5% w/w Nafion solution, 720 μL ethanol and 240 μL deionized water were mixed and ultrasonicated for 1 h to make a homogeneous ink, and 100 μL of ink was taken and coated on 1 × 1 cm2 hydrophobic carbon paper. After natural drying, the Bi2(CrO4)3 was electro-reduced at −0.9 V vs RHE in 0.5 M KHCO3 for 1 h to obtain the Bi-Cr2O3 catalyst. Characterizations The catalysts were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, FEI QuattroS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-F200, Japan), X-ray diffraction (XRD, RigakuD/MAX2500 V, Cu K radiation), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Fisher Scientific, ESCALAB 250Xi+). Raman spectra were obtained with a Horiba iHR550 spectrometer at 532 nm excitation wavelength. NMR spectra of formate were measured on a Bruker 400 MHz spectrometer, Germany. Gas Chromatography (FULI, GC-9790II) was used to analyze online gas products. Electrochemical measurements Electrochemical tests were performed using the CHI660E constant potential meter in an H-type electrolytic cell separated by a cation exchange membrane (Nafion 117), and each chamber of the electrolytic cell was injected with 40 mL of 0.5 M KHCO3. The working electrode chamber was purged of CO2 gas at least half an hour before the test, and the flow rate of CO2 was 20 mL min−1 during the experiment. The working electrode is carbon paper loaded with the Bi-Cr2O3, which is used for electrochemical tests in combination with the Ag/AgCl (3.5 M KCl) electrode as the reference electrode and the platinum foil electrode as the counter electrode. The potentials used in the experiment were converted to RHE by the equation. E (vs RHE) = E (vs Ag/ AgCl) + 0.0591 × pH + 0.2046. Linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) was measured in N2 and CO2-saturated environments with a scanning speed of 20 mV s − 1. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed in a CO2-saturated 0.5 M KHCO3 solution at a potential of −1.0 V vs RHE. Double-layer capacitance (Cdl) of the catalyst was tested by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in N2 environment at different scan rates (20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 mV s − 1). The CV curves were tested in a non-Faraday range from 0.47 to 0.57 V vs RHE. The calculation formula of ECSA is as follow: E C S A = C d l C s (Cs is the is the specific capacitance in a value of 20 μF cm−2). The ECSA-normalized formate partial current density (j formate(ECSA)) is calculated by the formula: j f o r m a t e ( E C S A ) = j t o t a l × F E f o r m a t e × C s C d l , wherein j total is the total current tested under different potential, FEformate is the Faraday efficiency of formate. Analysis of products The gas products were analyzed every 15 min using the online gas chromatograph (FULI, GC-9790II). The liquid product was detected using the nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer (NMR, Bruker 400 MHz spectrometer) and then compared to the standard curve to obtain the amount of formic acid. Standard curves were obtained by testing a range of sodium formate concentrations (0.4 mM, 0.8 mM, 1.0 mM, 4.0 mM, and 8.0 mM) (Fig. S1). The FE of the product is calculated as follows: F E = z × n × F Q × 100 % where z is the number of electrons transferred from the reactant to the product, n is the amount of product formed by the reaction process (mol), and Q is the total number of electronic transfers. Zn-CO2 battery The electrolytic cell was divided into two chambers by a bipolar membrane and each chamber was filled with 35 mL of newly prepared liquid. The cathode liquid was 1.0 M KHCO3 with a cathodic CO2 flow rate of 20 mL min−1, and the anode solution was 1 M KOH and 0.2 M Zn(AC)2. The anode was a 2 × 2.5 cm2 freshly polished Zn foil, and the cathode catalytic material was prepared in the same way as the Bi-Cr2O3 catalyst in the previous section. The whole experiment was carried out on a CHI660E constant potential meter. Results and discussion Synthesis and characterization The synthesis of Bi-Cr2O3 can be divided into two sections (Fig. 1 ). The first part is the generation of the Bi2(CrO4)3 precursor by a co-precipitation reaction (2Bi3++ 3CrO4 2− → Bi2(CrO4)3) in the K2CrO4 and Bi(NO3)3 solutions. Second, the Bi-Cr2O3 is obtained via an electrochemical reduction treatment of the Bi2(CrO4)3 precursor. The XRD pattern of the precursor (Fig. S2) is identical to that of Bi2(CrO4)3 documented in the literature [31]. The XPS survey spectrum of Bi2(CrO4)3 shows that the elements in the precursor contain only Bi, Cr, O, and a small amount of polluting carbon (Fig. S3). The Raman spectrum (Fig. S4) clearly presents the stretching peak of CrO4 2− at 845 cm−1 [32,33]. This together with the XRD and XPS results demonstrates the successful synthesis of Bi2(CrO4)3. After electroreduction treatment, the XRD analysis (Fig. 2 a) reveals that the phase has changed obviously. The diffraction peaks derived from the Bi2(CrO4)3 completely disappear, and the newly emerged peaks correspond exactly to the rhombohedral Bi (JCPDS No. 44–1246). Here, the diffraction peaks at 27°, 37.8°, and 39.5° can be the attributed to the (012), (104), and (110) planes of rhombohedral Bi, and the peaks at 17.9°, 26.1°, and 54.3° are ascribed to the carbon paper. No diffraction peak of Cr2O3 was detected in the XRD patterns, implying its amorphous or nanocrystalline structure. The Raman spectrum clearly proves that the reduced sample is essentially a mixed phase of Bi and Cr2O3. As shown in Fig. 2b, two bands at 69 and 90 cm−1 can be attributed to the Eg and A1g modes of Bi, respectively [34], and the bands observed at 730 cm−1 and 823 cm−1 are corresponding to the Cr3+-O bond vibrations of amorphous Cr2O3 [35,36]. The Raman bands at 118, 289, and 311 cm−1 are assigned to the vibrations of the Bi-O bond, which may be due to the O adsorption as well as oxidation of Bi on the surface [37]. Further characterization by SEM and TEM reveals that the obtained Bi-Cr2O3 exhibits a nano-dendritic morphology, which grows in different directions to form a three-dimensional structure filled with voids (Fig. 2c, 2d). In Fig. 2e, the high-resolution TEM image clearly shows that Bi-Cr2O3 consists of crystalline and amorphous components. The crystal has well-resolved lattice stripes with a spacing of 0.32 nm corresponding to the (012) lattice plane of Bi, which is consistent with the XRD analysis. The immediately adjacent amorphous region should stem from the Cr2O3 phase. The Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) images of the nano-dendrite show that the samples contained Bi, Cr, and O, and the distribution of these three elements is relatively over most areas (Fig. 2f), further manifesting the formation of the Bi-Cr2O3 phases. To further demonstrate the valence state of the constituent elements, we examined the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of the sample before and after the reduction. The XPS spectrogram of Bi 4f (Fig. 3 a) shows that Bi2(CrO4)3 has two distinct peaks Bi 4f5/2 (164.7 eV) and Bi 4f7/2 (159.4 eV) corresponding to Bi3+ [38,39]. The reduced samples can be back-convoluted into different valence states of Bi. Among them, Bi 4f5/2 (164.7) and Bi 4f7/2 (159.4) belong to Bi3+, and Bi 4f5/2 (163.8) and Bi 4f7/2 (158.5) belong to Bi0, indicating that Bi3+ is reduced to Bi0 during the reduction process [40,41]. The reduced sample contains a small amount of Bi3+, which is originated from the surface oxidation of the metallic Bi and consistent with the Raman result. The peaks of Cr 2p3/2 (579.7 eV) and Cr 2p1/2 (588.9 eV) in Bi2(CrO4)3 are transformed into the peaks of Cr 2p3/2 (577.1 eV) and Cr 2p1/2 (586.4 eV) after the electroreduction(Fig. 3b), indicating that the valence state of Cr atoms changes from +6 to +3 [31,42,43]. This is in line with the Raman analysis, which proves that there is no Cr6+ in the reduced sample, and the remaining Cr is Cr3+ and exists as amorphous Cr2O3. Based on the above analysis, it can be concluded that the Bi2(CrO4)3 precursor is transformed into Bi-Cr2O3 crystalline-amorphous nano-dendrites. CO2RR performance To evaluate the CO2RR performance of Bi-Cr2O3, we performed electrochemical tests in an H-type electrolyzer with 0.5 M KHCO3 solution as the electrolyte. Commercial Bi powder was used as a comparison sample. The linear scanning voltammetry curves were tested in N2-saturated and CO2-saturated solutions, wherein the current densities of Bi-Cr2O3 and Bi powder tested in CO2-saturated environments are much higher than those tested in N2-saturated environments, suggesting that both Bi-Cr2O3 and Bi powder tend to catalyze the CO2RR rather than HER (Fig. 4 a). At the same time, the current density of Bi-Cr2O3 obtained under CO2-saturated conditions is significantly higher than that of Bi powder under the equal conditions over the entire test range despite the poor electrical conductivity of transition metal oxide Cr2O3 [44]. For example, the current density of Bi-Cr2O3 is −70 mA cm−2 at −1.3 V vs RHE, whereas the Bi powder is −42 mA cm−2 at the same potential, which suggests the superior CO2RR performance of Bi-Cr2O3. In addition, in an effort to investigate the impact of potential on CO2 reduction product, the i-t-test was performed for 2400s at the potentials ranging from −0.8 to −1.3 V vs RHE. Meanwhile, the reaction products were qualitatively and quantitatively assayed by online gas chromatography (GC) and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Based on the measurements, the compositions of products over the potential range were determined as formate, CO, and H2, where H2 was the mainly cathodic competitive product (Fig. S5). Fig. S6 shows the partial current density for formate (j formate) of Bi-Cr2O3 and Bi powder, and the j formate of Bi-Cr2O3 catalyst is more than twice higher compared to Bi powder at all potentials, indicating the high formate selectivity of Bi-Cr2O3 catalyst for CO2RR. As shown in Fig. 4b, the highest Faraday efficiency of formate (FEformate) catalyzed by Bi powder is only 81.9 % at −0.9 V vs RHE and the FEformate of Bi powder constantly decreases with the increase or decrease of potential. But for the Bi-Cr2O3 catalyst (Fig. 4c), the FEformate is 92.3 % at −0.9 V vs RHE, and the FEformate still increased with the increase of the potential. The Bi-Cr2O3 achieved a high FEformate of 93.3 % at −1.1 V vs RHE. Furthermore, the FEformate of the Bi-Cr2O3 catalyst can attain 90 % under a wide potential window of 400 mV (−0.8∼−1.2 V vs RHE). In addition, the j formate of Bi-Cr2O3 also is higher than that of Bi powder (Fig. S6) and most recently reported Bi-based catalysts at the same potential (Table S1). At the same time, the Bi-Cr2O3 catalyst also shows competitive selectivity. These results demonstrate the high activity and outstanding selectivity of Bi-Cr2O3 catalyst for the CO2RR towards formate. Meanwhile, the stability of Bi-Cr2O3 was measured by a chrono-current experiment at −0.9 V vs RHE. As exhibited in Fig. 4d, the current density remains stable over 13 h and the FEformate is consistently above 90 % during the long-term electrolysis. Moreover, the XRD patterns of the sample after the stability test (Fig. S7) are the same as those before the test, and the SEM (Fig. S8) shows that the microscopic morphology is well maintained, implying the high stability of the Bi-Cr2O3 catalyst for CO2RR. To reveal the impact of the incorporation of Cr2O3 on the reaction kinetics, the Tafel slopes of Bi-Cr2O3 and Bi powder were calculated for comparison. Fig. 5 a shows that the Tafel slope of Bi-Cr2O3 is 155 mV dec−1, which is much smaller than the 211 mV dec−1 of Bi powder. Since the Tafel slope of Bi-Cr2O3 and Bi powder are much closer to 118 mV dec−1, the rate-determining step (RDS) is a procedure that CO2 adsorbed on the catalyst surface acquires electrons to form *CO2 − [45]. The slope of Bi-Cr2O3 is much smaller than Bi powder, which means that the CO2RR kinetic of Bi can be effectively improved by the incorporation of Lewis acid Cr2O3. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests (Fig. S9) show that Bi-Cr2O3 has a much lower charge transfer resistance (Rct) than Bi powder, indicating that Bi-Cr2O3 is more susceptible to charge transfer with the reactants and electrodes [46,47]. This is in accordance with the Tafel analysis. To determine the intrinsic activity of the catalysts, we further tested the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) to evaluate the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) normalized activity (Fig. S10). As exhibited in Fig. 5b, the Cdl of Bi-Cr2O3 and Bi powder are determined as 130 and 111 μF, respectively, indicating that the Bi-Cr2O3 catalyst reveals more active sites for CO2RR than Bi powder. The ECSA normalized current density of Bi-Cr2O3 at the same potential is much higher than that of Bi powder (Fig. 5c), indicating the high intrinsic activity of the Bi-Cr2O3 and the introduction of Cr2O3 could effectively enhance the intrinsic activity of Bi [48]. To further illustrate the effect of Cr2O3 addition on the activity and selectivity, we explored the affinity of the catalysts for *CO2 – radical intermediates using OH− as a substitute, as the binding strength of *CO2 – is directly proportional to that of OH− [49]. Fig. 5d shows that the peak of Bi powder is more positive, indicating that Bi powder has a weaker affinity for *CO2 –, while the more negative reduction peak of Bi-Cr2O3 suggests that *CO2 – is more strongly adsorbed on the surface of Bi-Cr2O3 [50]. Due to the Lewis acid-base neutralization effect, the Lewis acid Cr2O3 tends to adsorb O atoms of CO2 molecule to generate *CO2 –. The stronger adsorption of *CO2 – on the surface of Bi-Cr2O3 can promote the O-linked *CO2 – to further bind with protons to form OCHO* intermediates, which enables the catalyst high activity and selectivity [51]. Zn-CO2 battery performance Considering the excellent CO2RR performance of the Bi-Cr2O3 catalyst, we further designed a water-rechargeable Zn-CO2 battery using Bi-Cr2O3 as the cathode catalyst to investigate the potential for application in energy conversion devices. A self-assembled rechargeable Zn-CO2 battery was designed as shown in Fig. 6 a. The battery is separated into two chambers by a bipolar membrane to prevent solution contamination. The anode was a polished Zn foil immersed in a mixed electrolyte of 1 M KOH and 0.02 M Zn(AC)2, and the cathode solution was 1 M KHCO3, with Bi-Cr2O3 as the cathode catalyst. As can be seen in Fig. 6b, the open circuit voltage (OCV) of the assembled Zn-CO2 battery is 1.27 V vs. Zn/Zn2+ and has been stable for 120 min. Fig. 6c shows the charge and discharge polarization curves, illustrating the rechargeability of the assembled battery. The Zn-CO2 battery driven by a Bi-Cr2O3 catalyst has an utmost power density of 4.63 mW cm−2 at −9.2 mA cm−2, suggesting the possibility of utilizing CO2 to generate electricity (Fig. 6d). At the same time, the cathode product was tested at the current densities from 1 mA cm−2 to 6 mA cm−2, and the FEformate is greater than 65 % over the entire test range. At the current density of 5 mA cm−2, the FEformate was 85.9 %, indicating that CO2 is mainly converted to formic acid during discharge (Fig. S11). Notably, the galvanostatic discharge-charge cycling curves (Fig. 6e) were tested at 1.0 mA cm−2, and the curves remain stable for 40 h, demonstrating the excellent durability of the Zn-CO2 battery assembled with Bi-Cr2O3 catalysts. Compared with other Zn-CO2 batteries reported in recent years (Table S2), the Zn-CO2 battery assembled with Bi-Cr2O3 catalysts has higher power density and relatively good charge-discharge stability. Conclusion In summary, a Bi-Cr2O3 crystalline-amorphous nano-dendrites was prepared for the first time by electrochemical reduction of precursor Bi2(CrO4)3. The as-prepared Bi-Cr2O3 catalyst shows a good CO2RR activity and a high formic acid selectivity. More precisely, the current density can reach −40.7 mA cm−2 at −1.1 V vs RHE with a high FEformate of 93.3 %. Impressively, the Bi-Cr2O3 catalyst can attain 90 % FEformate over a wide potential window (−0.8 ∼ −1.2 V vs RHE) and maintain 13 h stability at −0.9 V vs RHE with stable selectivity. This excellent performance is attributed to the introduction of the Lewis acid Cr2O3, which tends to bind the O atom of the CO2 molecule to form the intermediate *OCHO and give rise to improving the intrinsic activity and selectivity. Meanwhile, the as-prepared Bi-Cr2O3 catalyst possesses high ECSA, thus increasing the apparent CO2RR activity. Furthermore, the Zn-CO2 battery constructed with Bi-Cr2O3 as the cathode catalyst has a peak power density of 4.63 mW cm−2 and maintains chargeable and dischargeable characteristics for 40 h with long-term durability. This work provides a new perspective for optimizing the performance of CO2RR towards formate.

        "dc:description": "Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to formic acid is a much-anticipated way of converting excess CO2 to high-value-added products. Bismuth (Bi)-based materials are promising catalysts, but remain challenging in terms of activity and selectivity. Herein, we reported a composition manipulation strategy to achieve simultaneous high activity and selectivity for CO2RR towards formate by incorporating Lewis acid Cr2O3 into Bi. Specifically, a novel Bi-Cr2O3 crystalline-amorphous catalyst was prepared by electroreduction of bismuth chromate (Bi2(CrO4)3). The as-prepared catalyst shows nano-dendrites structure, promising the maximum exposure of active sites. The obtained Bi-Cr2O3 catalyst exhibits a high Faradic efficiency (FEformate, 93.3 %) at −1.1 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and can achieve a remarkable current density of −40.7 mA cm−2 at the same potential. Meanwhile, the FEformate remains above 90 % over a wide potential window (−0.8 ∼ −1.2 V vs RHE) and the stability can maintain for 13 h at −0.9 V vs RHE with high selectivity (>90 %) and stable physical phase. Furthermore, the Zn-CO2 battery assembled with a Bi-Cr2O3 catalyst achieves the greatest power density of 4.63 mW cm−2 and could maintain cyclic charge/discharge stability for 40 h.",
