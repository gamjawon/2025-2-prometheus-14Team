Graphical abstract A series of NiNC-T catalysts with adjustable microstructure was prepared by combining nickel phthalocyanine pyrolysis and acid etching strategy, which either contain only Ni single atoms (SAs) or both Ni SAs and Ni nanoparticles (NPs). The optimal NiNC-1100 catalyst demonstrated a remarkable FEco of 99 % at −0.66 V vs. RHE, along with a broad potential window ranging from −0.66 V to −1.06 V vs. RHE, maintaining a FEco exceeding 98 % throughout. Notably, the FECO of NiNC-1100 sustained above 95 % even after 100h electrocatalysis, significantly outperforming the latest pyrolized Ni-N-C-based electrocatalysts. The prominent performance of the NiNC-1100 catalyst can be attributed to its high degree of graphitization, large surface area, and the synergistic interaction between Ni SAs and Ni NPs. Transition metal-nitrogen-carbon (M−N−C) are considered as promising candidates for the electrochemical conversion of inert CO2 into high value-added CO products. However, previous reports have focused on Ni single-atom sites (Ni SAs) and the role of Ni nanoparticles (Ni NPs) in CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2RR) has been overlooked. Herein, we prepared a series of Ni, N-codoped porous carbon (NiNC-T, T represents the temperature) catalysts by combining Ni phthalocyanine pyrolysis and acid etching strategy, which either contain only Ni SAs or both Ni SAs and Ni NPs. Notably, the NiNC-1100 catalyst with both Ni SAs and Ni NPs exhibited 99 % CO faradaic efficiency (FECO) at −0.66 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) and FECO above 98 % over a wide potential range (−0.66 V ∼ −1.06 V). Moreover, the FECO of NiNC-1100 remained above 95 % after 100 h of continuous electrocatalysis, which was significantly superior to that of the most advanced Ni single atom electrocatalysts. The systematic characterization results showed that the introduction of Ni NPs can promote the adsorption and activation of CO2 by increasing the electron cloud density of Ni SAs, thus enhancing the CO2RR catalytic performance.

CO2RR in aqueous solution is a promising approach for converting inert CO2 into high-value-added chemicals, including CO, CH4, C2H4, CH3OH [1–4]. M−N−C catalysts have emerged as a fascinating class of efficient catalysts for the CO2RR, attributed to their superior conductivity, high atomic utilization and specific product selectivity [5–10]. Among various M−N−C catalysts, the atomically dispersed Ni-N-C has attracted much attention and is regarded as an ideal catalyst for CO2RR due to its diverse coordination structures and excellent catalytic performance [11–13]. Generally, the Ni atoms with varying N species/atomic number coordination in Ni-N-C catalysts are identified as the active sites for CO2RR, attributed to their low reaction energy barriers [14–16]. However, comprehensive consideration is lacking regarding the role of Ni NPs in CO2RR, which has often been overlooked in the past due to their favorable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance [17–20]. Recent studies have recognized that the presence of metal nanoparticles in M−N−C catalysts can potentially influence catalytic activity by altering the electron configuration of the MNx centers within the subsurface region [21–25]. Regulating the microstructure of Ni sites via high-temperature pyrolysis of different Ni-based complex precursors represents a feasible and effective approach to improve the performance of CO2RR. It is likely due to the fact that high-temperature pyrolysis significantly reduces the content of N doping, introduces inherent defects on the carbon material surface [26–28], and reconstructs N species to yield structurally stable and diverse MNx active centers [29–32]. Therefore, revealing the role of Ni SAs and their peripheral factors within Ni-N-C catalysts, as well as elucidating their catalytic reaction mechanisms in CO2RR, poses a significant challenge. In the present work, we prepared a series of transition metal and N-codoped porous carbon (MNC-T, T represents the temperature) catalysts by pyrolysis of metal phthalocyanine (MPc, M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn) precursors and subsequent acid etching strategies in the presence of MgO templates. The CO2RR results showed that the catalysts prepared with NiPc as precursor exhibited the best catalytic performance among all synthesized catalysts, and the CO faradaic efficiency (FECO) of NiNC-1100 was as high as 99 % at −0.66 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE). Furthermore, the FECO was above 98 % over a wide potential range (−0.66 V ∼ −1.06 V) and remained above 95 % after 100 h of continuous electrocatalysis for NiNC-1100 catalyst, which was significantly superior than that of the most advanced Ni single atom electrocatalysts. The aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-STEM) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analysis revealed that a large amount of Ni SAs and Ni NPs were simultaneously present in the NiNC-1100 catalyst, which was in stark contrast to the NiNC-800 catalyst containing only Ni SAs sites. Combined with the experimental results and previous studies, it can be concluded that the introduction of Ni NPs can promote the adsorption and activation of CO2 by increasing the electron cloud density of Ni SAs, thus improving the catalytic performance of CO2RR. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and reagents Magnesium oxide (MgO, 99.99 %, 10–20 nm) was provided by Adamas-beta (Shanghai) chemical reagent Co., Ltd. Cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc), iron phthalocyanine (FePc), nickel phthalocyanine (NiPc), zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) and copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Chloroform (CH3Cl), hydrochloric acid (HCl) and ethanol (EtOH) were provided by Meryer Co., Ltd. All reagents did not require further purification. 2.2 Synthesis of NiNC-T catalysts Typically, 1.0 g of NiPc and 2.0 g of MgO were dispersed in 30 mL solvent (EtOH: CHCl3 = 2:1). The mixture solution was stirred at room temperature for 6 h, then the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation under vacuum. The resulting solid powder was thermally treated in tube furnace at 800 °C for 2 h under flowing N2 (heating rate 3 °C/min), and then the composite was cooled to room temperature. The obtained sample was etched with 1.0 M HCl at 100 °C for 6 h to completely remove the MgO template, followed by washing with deionized water to neutral. The final solid powder was denoted as NiNC-800 (NC stands for N-doped porous carbon, 800 represents pyrolysis temperature). Expect for different pyrolysis temperature, the identical procedure was applied to prepare NiNC-900, NiNC-1000 and NiNC-1100 for comparative analysis. 2.3 Synthesis of MNC-800 and NC-800 control catalysts As a control, FeNC-800, CoNC-800, CuNC-800, ZnNC-800 and NC-800 catalysts were synthesized adopting a similar method to NiNC-800 catalyst. NiPc was substituted with FePc, CoPc, CuPc, ZnPc and Pc, respectively, and the other experimental procedures are identical to the synthesis of NiNC-800. 2.4 Characterization Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) utilized in this study was the FEI Tecnai F20, operating at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The catalysts were sonicated to dispersed in ethanol, and a droplet of the obtained solution was deposited onto a micro-scale copper grid. X-ray diffraction (XRD) data in the 2θ range of 5 to 90° were acquired using Cu-Kα radiation on the Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were analyzed using a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha, and the 1 s spectral line of C was corrected to 284.8 eV as the binding energy reference. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectra of the Ni K edge were analyzed using the 1W2B beam at the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured at 77.35 K using a Quantachrome ASIQM0002-5 analyzer, with the samples pre-outgassed pre-outgassed under a vacuum of 393 K for 6 h. The specific surface areas of the samples were calculated using Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) method, and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model was used to calculate the pore volumes and size distributions. Raman spectra were performed by a confocal Raman spectrometer (LabRAM HR Evolution) with a laser of 532 nm wavelength. The metal (Ni, Fe, Co, Cu and Zn) contents of the catalysts were conducted by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, NexION 350). 1H Nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) was employed for the analysis of the composition of the liquid phase products, with solvent pressurization technology utilized to mitigate water interference. 3 Results and Discussion 3.1 Synthesis and characterizations of the MNC-T catalysts As depicted in Scheme 1 , the NiNC-T catalysts were fabricated via a straightforward thermal treatment process utilizing MgO as a templating agent. Firstly, solid NiPc@MgO composites were achieved by self-assembly of NiPc and MgO templates. Subsequently, the obtained composite materials underwent thermal treatment under N2 atmosphere and the template and unstable Ni substance were removed by etching. The obtained solid powders were labeled as NiNC-T (T = 800, 900, 1000 and 1100 °C). A comparable synthesis protocol was employed to produceNC-800, FeNC-800, CoNC-800, CuNC-800 and ZnNC-800. In the synthesis of the other catalysts, NiPc was substituted with Pc, FePc, CoPc, CuPc and ZnPc, respectively, while maintaining identical experimental procedures as those used for the synthesis of NiNC-800. The morphology and microstructure of the NiNC-T catalysts were observed by TEM. These catalysts exhibit porous and wrinkled characteristics resembling a honeycomb structure (Fig. 1 a, b and Figure S1). High-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) with spherical aberration correction clearly indicated two distinct bright spots of varying sizes on the surface of NiNC-1100, corresponding to carbon-coated Ni NPs and highly dispersed Ni SAs, respectively (Fig. 1c–e) [29]. The diameter of Ni NPs was approximately 50 nm, attributed to Ni species agglomeration during pyrolysis [33]. Additionally, the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) data from Fig. 1e revealed a uniform distribution of C, N, O and Ni elements, along with isolated Ni element mapping, illustrating uniform dispersion of Ni SAs in the NiNC-1100 sample (Fig. 1f). The XRD patterns of NiNC-T catalysts exhibited a diffraction peak at 26.2°, attributed to the characteristic (002) plane of graphitic carbon (Fig. 2 a) [34,35]. The intensity of the C (002) peak increased as the pyrolysis temperature rose, indicating an increase in the degree of graphitization increased. The NiNC-900, NiNC-1000 and NiNC-1100 showed an additional weak diffraction peak at 44.6°, corresponding to the (111) facet of Ni NPs [36,37]. However, no diffraction peaks associated with metal crystals or oxides were observed in MNC-800 (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn), which are similar to the metal-free NC-800 sample (Fig. 2d). The specific surface area of the NiNC-T catalysts, determined via Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis, ranged from 480.0 m2∙g−1 to 526.6 m2∙g−1, while the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model was employed for calculating an average pore diameter of 3.85 nm (Table S1). Notably, NiNC-1100 exhibited the highest surface area and pore volume (526.6 m2∙g−1, 1.987 cm3∙g−1). The larger specific surface area facilitates exposure of metal active sites, while the mesoporous structure enhances diffusion of reactant molecules [38]. Raman spectra of NiNC-T catalysts exhibited two characteristic peaks at 1347 cm−1 and 1580 cm−1, corresponding to disordered sp3 carbon (D band) and graphitic sp2 carbon (G band), respectively, demonstrating that the Ni phthalocyanine precursor has undergone pyrolysis to yield Ni, N-codoped graphitized carbon materials (Figure S2) [39]. XPS was employed to analyze the surface composition and valence state information of NiNC-T. High-resolution XPS survey spectra revealed the presence of C, O, N and Ni signals in NiNC-T catalysts (Figure S3). As displayed in Fig. 3 a–d, the high-resolution N 1s XPS spectra of NiNC-T catalysts exhibited five distinct nitrogen species: pyridinic N, Ni-N, pyrrolic N, graphitic N and oxidized N [12,40,41]. It is worth noting that the peak area ratio of Ni-N decreased gradually with the rising pyrolysis temperature, whereas the proportion of graphitic N showed an increasing trend. This trend was attributed to the degree of high-temperature graphitization and aggregation of Ni species [42]. For the NiNC-1100 catalyst, the peaks of pyridinic N and pyrrolic N shifted to the lower binding energies upon the introduction of Ni NPs. This shift facilitated the provision of additional electrons from the N species to Ni SAs, enhancing the adsorption and activation of CO2 (Table S2) [43,44]. In Fig. 3e–h, the NiNC-800 catalyst exhibited solely the Ni2+ peak, whereas for NiNC-T catalysts, both Ni0 and Ni2+ peaks were observed. Moreover, as the pyrolysis temperature continued to rise, the proportion of the Ni0 peak increased, implying the presence of Ni species in the form of Ni SAs and Ni NPs in these catalysts at the temperatures exceeding 900 °C [41,45]. Therefore, the enhanced graphitization degree of the NiNC-1100 catalyst, along with the incorporation of Ni NPs, facilitated electron conduction, leading to an increase in the electron cloud density of Ni SAs. This synergistic effect ultimately augmented the catalytic activity of CO2RR [46]. To illustrate the electronic and microstructural characteristics of Ni species within NiNC-T, XAS was further employed. Analysis of the Ni K-edge spectra from X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) revealed that the absorption edges of NiNC-800, NiNC-900, NiNC-1000 and NiNC-1100 resided between Ni foil and NiO. As the pyrolysis temperature increases, the absorption edges shifted closer to that of Ni foil (Fig. 4 a). The results indicated that the valence state of Ni ranged from 0 to +2, gradually approaching 0 with increasing pyrolysis temperature. This trend could be attributed to the high-temperature aggregation of Ni during the pyrolysis process. Analysis of the Fourier transform (FT) k 3-weighted χ(k)-function derived from the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) revealed two peaks at 1.43 Å and 2.20 Å, which correspond to Ni-N and Ni-Ni bond, respectively [47,48]. As the pyrolysis temperature rose, the intensity of the Ni–N peak diminished, whereas the Ni–Ni peak intensified, illustrating the formation of a greater number of Ni NPs. For NiNC-800, the absence of a Ni–Ni peak at 2.20 Å suggests the existence of Ni species as single atoms, corroborating the XRD findings depicted in Fig. 4b [48]. The wavelet transforms (WT) of EXAFS data, as shown in Fig. 4d–f, exhibited nearly identical contour plots for the Ni-Ni bond in NiNC-1100 and Ni foil, thereby confirming the presence of Ni NPs in the NiNC-1100 catalyst [49,50]. To further determine the atomic structure of NiNC-1100, curve fitting analysis was performed on the EXAFS spectra. According to the fitting results presented in Table S3, the coordination number of Ni-Ni bond in NiNC-1100 is 5.4, whereas the coordination number of Ni-N bond is 1.3. However, it is difficult to provide an accurate coordination structure of atomic Ni-N in NiNC-1100 catalyst, probably due to the low weight ratio of Ni SAs relative to Ni NPs [51,52]. 3.2 Electrocatalytic performance of CO2RR The CO2RR performance of the aforementioned catalysts was evaluated in an H-type cell with Nafion@117 exchange membrane to separate the anode and cathode, and the electrolyte used was 0.5 M KHCO3. Fig. 5 a depicts the results of linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) tests conducted to assess the electrocatalytic activity of the NiNC-T catalysts across various pyrolysis temperatures. Compared to Ar atmosphere, the LSV curve of NiNC-1100 exhibited a more pronounced response current and lower initial overpotential, indicating its catalytic activity towards CO2RR (Figure S4a) [53]. Compared to NiNC-800, NiNC-900, NiNC-1000 and NiNC-1100 catalysts exhibited a higher current density of −20 mA cm−2 at −0.66 V vs. RHE. Fig. 5b presents the evaluation of the Faradaic efficiency of CO (FECO) for these catalysts across various voltages. Notably, the FECO of NiNC-1100 catalyst was superior to that of the NiNC-800 in the entire range of potential studied. The FECO of NiNC-1100 reached a peak of 99 % at −0.66 V vs. RHE and consistently maintained values above 98 % across a wide potential, ranging from −0.66 to −1.06 V vs. RHE. Furthermore, 1H NMR analysis revealed no detection of liquid products in the electrolyte obtained after 1 h of electrolysis, confirming the excellent CO selectivity of the catalyst (Fig. S4b) [54]. The partial current density of CO (j CO) for the NiNC-1100 catalyst consistently exceeded that of NiNC-T catalysts at investigated potentials (Fig. 5c). To assess the intrinsic activity of the NiNC-T catalysts prepared at different pyrolysis temperatures, the turnover frequency (TOF) of CO2 to CO was also calculated, assuming equal accessibility and activity of all Ni sites. The ICP-MS measurements revealed Ni contents of 3.51, 3.37, 2.58 and 1.78 wt% for the NiNC-800, NiNC-900, NiNC-1000 and NiNC-1100 catalysts, respectively (Table S4). As shown in Fig. 5d, the TOF of NiNC-1100 exceeded that of NiNC-T prepared at 800, 900 and 1000 °C across various electrolytic voltages, suggesting that the synergistic interaction between Ni SAs and Ni NPs improves the CO2RR performance [55]. As shown in Fig. 5e and f, the CO2RR performance of NiNC-800 catalyst significantly outperformed both the MNC-800 (M = Fe, Co, Cu and Zn) and NC-800 catalysts, highlighting the pivotal role of metallic Ni species in enhancing the CO2RR performance. To investigate the reaction mechanism, the Tafel slope for CO production at the NiNC-1100 electrode was determined to be 143.6 mV dec-1, significantly lower than that of NiNC-800 (216.5 mV dec-1), NiNC-900 (205.8 mV dec-1) and NiNC-1000 (163.0 mV dec-1) catalysts, indicating a higher favorability for the first electron transfer (Figure S5a) [56,57]. The EIS of NiNC-1100 was significantly smaller compared to other reference catalysts, indicating that the NiNC-1100 catalyst exhibits the fastest charge transfer rate during the reaction, which is consistent with the observed CO2RR performance (Figure S5b). To further elucidate the catalytic active site of NiNC-1100 catalyst, the Ni SAs were poisoned using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and a metal-free N-doped porous carbon (NC-1100) was synthesized via a similar method with NiNC-1100 except using phthalocyanine as the precursor. The results of CO2RR indicated that N species and carbon-coated Ni NPs in NiNC-1100 catalyst lacked catalytic activity, with Ni SAs as the active sites, while carbon-coated Ni NPs enhanced synergy through electron transfer (Figure S6). The long-term stability of NiNC-1100 catalyst was further evaluated at −0.66 V vs. RHE. Fig. 5g proved that the FECO maintained at approximately 95 % after 100 h of continuous electrolysis, indicating improved stability and significantly superior ensemble performance compared to other catalysts reported in the literature (Table S5). 4 Conclusion In conclusion, a series of MNC-T catalysts were prepared using MgO-templated high-temperature pyrolysis of metal phthalocyanine precursors followed by acid etching. The results of CO2RR revealed that the NiNC-800 catalyst outperforms other MNC-800 and NC-800 catalysts, indicating the suitability of Ni-based catalysts as promising active components for this reaction. A thorough analysis of the promising NiNC-T catalytic system revealed that the NiNC-800 catalyst exclusively features Ni SAs active sites, whereas the NiNC-1100 catalyst comprises both Ni SAs and Ni NPs. Notably, the NiNC-1100 catalyst demonstrated a remarkable FECO of 99 % at −0.66 V vs. RHE, maintaining an FECO above 98 % across a broad potential range (−0.66 V ∼ −1.06 V). Furthermore, its FECO remained above 95 % even after 100 h of continuous electrocatalysis. The prominent performance of the NiNC-1100 catalyst can be attributed to its high degree of graphitization, large surface area, and the synergistic interaction between Ni SAs and Ni NPs, facilitating efficient CO2-to-CO conversion. Consequently, this study offers valuable insights for the development of highly efficient catalysts in the realms of renewable energy, environmental remediation, and fine chemical synthesis.

        "dc:description": "Transition metal-nitrogen-carbon (M−N−C) are considered as promising candidates for the electrochemical conversion of inert CO2 into high value-added CO products. However, previous reports have focused on Ni single-atom sites (Ni SAs) and the role of Ni nanoparticles (Ni NPs) in CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2RR) has been overlooked. Herein, we prepared a series of Ni, N-codoped porous carbon (NiNC-T, T represents the temperature) catalysts by combining Ni phthalocyanine pyrolysis and acid etching strategy, which either contain only Ni SAs or both Ni SAs and Ni NPs. Notably, the NiNC-1100 catalyst with both Ni SAs and Ni NPs exhibited 99 % CO faradaic efficiency (FECO) at −0.66 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) and FECO above 98 % over a wide potential range (−0.66 V ∼ −1.06 V). Moreover, the FECO of NiNC-1100 remained above 95 % after 100 h of continuous electrocatalysis, which was significantly superior to that of the most advanced Ni single atom electrocatalysts. The systematic characterization results showed that the introduction of Ni NPs can promote the adsorption and activation of CO2 by increasing the electron cloud density of Ni SAs, thus enhancing the CO2RR catalytic performance.",
