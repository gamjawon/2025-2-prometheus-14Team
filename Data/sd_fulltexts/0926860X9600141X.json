Tsybuleeski et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 85-94 plants for sulphur production from acid gases [1]. The most widespread pro- cesses are so-called sub-dew point processes 'Sulfreen', CBA and MCRC [1,2] owing to the low cost of their realization and operation simplicity. They are all based on the Claus reaction: 2H2S + SO2--->3/XSx+H20 at the sulphur sub-dew point, and on sulphur absorption by the 'cold bed' and they differ only in the technique and the scheme of the catalyst regeneration. In these processes, as a rule, an active alumina with high surface area (no less than 300 mZ/g) is used as a catalyst [3,4]. As the requirements of environment protection in most countries of the world are becoming more and more strict, research effort has recently gone into the improvement of treating process tail gases and of catalysts for them to provide an increase in the attained degree of sulphur recovery from acid gases [2,5,6]. As this takes place, much attention is paid to the search for an optimum porous structure, i.e. such relation of micro- and macropores in a catalyst which, at the minimum loading of catalysts into reactors, would provide effective conversion of H 2S and SO2 during the whole adsorption period until the reactor switches to the catalyst regeneration mode. In [7,8] some of us considered the influence of microporosity of alumina catalysts on their efficiency in TGTP. It was shown that the greater the volume of micropores and the smaller their radius, the greater the amount of sulphur that can be extracted by the catalysts and the smaller the sulphur losses in the vapour phase. At the same time, there are no doubts about the important role of macropores in the efficient operation of 'TGTP' catalysts. The present paper is devoted to theoretical and experimental study of the influence of macropores on the macrokinetics of the adsorption-catalytic tail gas treating process. 2. Experimental The catalysts used for this study were all made in a similar manner starting from gibbsite aluminum trihydroxide. They are commercially available as Alcoa DD-422, DD-440, DD-431 and TG-431 catalysts. In the manufacture these products are all made by flash calcining the gibbsite powder at 1000 to produce high surface area amorphous alumina powder. Then while forming into spheres, all the alumina rehydrates at 80. Final activation heat treatment is achieved at 400. The ball forming process was used to control the macrop- orosity (pores greater than 750 A diameter) but otherwise the alumina was the same. The alumina phase was determined by X-ray diffraction analyses to be chi-eta. The pore volume distribution was measured by benzene adsorption and by the mercury porosimetry method. The pore volume for radii range 10-120 A was calculated from the desorption branch of the benzene isotherms of the samples A.M.

The pore radii range of 100-100 000 A was characterized by the mercury porosimetry method. The catalytic activity of the samples in the Claus reaction at the TGTP temperature (ca. 130) was measured by the microreactor method in the pulse chromatographic regime: this technique was described in detail in [10]. The samples were tested also in a TGTP pilot plant unit whose flow diagram is shown in Fig. 1. The unit consisted of the following main sections: - a gas preparation section which included vessels with the initial compo- nents of the gas mixtures, rotameters, a water pump, a water evaporator and a gas mixer; - a reactor with a sulphur collector and a stabilized heating system; - a waste gas neutralization section consisting of a filter-trap, a bubbler with a 20% alkaline solution, a candle to burn the neutralized gases; - a laboratory chromatograph to analyze the initial and the waste gases. A humidified gas mixture of the given composition was fed into the reactor (8) of the inner diameter ca. 80 mm and 1400 mm long. The volume of the reactor for loading the samples into the constant temperature zone was 2.0 1. Hydrogen sulphide and sulphur dioxide react over a catalyst to form sulphur which condenses in the catalyst layer. In the course of the experiment, gas samples were constantly taken and analyzed by means of the chromatograph (15). The results of the gas analysis were used to calculate the conversion degree of H2S + SO2. Two series of experimental tests were conducted. For determining of so-called 'sulphur capacity' the experiment was continued until the conversion degree dropped down to ca. 90%. Then the experiment was stopped and the tempera- 88 A.M. Tsybulevski et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 85-94 ture in the reactor was raised up to ca. 350 and the catalyst was regenerated in a nitrogen flow. The reactor (8) was equipped with a sluice which in the course of regenera- tion, allowed all melted sulphur in the tank (10) to be collected. After cooling, the sulphur was weighed and the so called 'sulphur capacity' was determined as a ratio of the weight of the sulphur obtained in the course of H2S and SO2 recovery to the catalyst weight. The discrepancy between the amount of the collected sulphur and that of H2S and SO2 fed during the experiment did not exceed _ 5%. In order to find out the influence of the macrokinetic factors on the dynamics of the adsorption-catalytic process and to obtain the breakthrough curves for H2S and SO2, another series of tests was conducted especially for this investiga- tion. In this case, the measurements of the reaction gases composition showed an effect after the conversion degree dropped below 90% and resulted in practically complete poisoning of the samples. The gas composition and the test conditions imitated a typical TGTP opera- tion regime. The gas composition (in vol.-%): H2S, 1.0; SO2, 0.5; H20, 30; N2, the rest. Temperature, 130.

In Fig. 2 differential curves of the pore volume distribution by the radii are shown. As can be seen, the only difference in the properties of the samples is the macroporosity, so that the differences in efficiency can be directly correlated to the catalyst macropore volume. The samples have practically identical micro- and mesopore volumes and surface area, whereas there occurs an almost triple increase in the macropore volume (> 750 A) ranging from a low of 0.06 to a high of 0.18 cm3/g for the sample 972. This is explained by the fact that the micro-mesoporosity is present in the flash calcined powder, whereas the macroporosity is created in the ball forming process by varying conditions.

The breakthrough curves for four alumina samples studied are shown on Fig. 3. Table 3 represents the sulphur capacity values obtained in the experiments. These data demonstrate clearly that the more macropore share in general the pore volume of catalyst the more its effective operation time before break- through and the higher its sulphur capacity reached. Nevertheless, the similarity of the breakthrough curves in Fig. 3 should be noted or, in other words, the rate of a sharp HzS, SO2 conversion drop is independent of the volume of macropores in the catalysts. 4. Discussion The Claus reaction has a superficial character, i.e. the reaction rate, first of all, is directly proportional to the catalyst surface area. Naturally, the predomi- Table 3 Sulphur capacity of AI203 samples with different macroporosity; t = 130; GHSV = 1200 h- 1 Sample number Fraction of macropores Experimental Calculated (Vm/XV, %) (g/cm3) (% mass) (% mass) 969 12.6 0.53 74.6 72.5 970 19.7 0.58 82.4 80.4 971 23.5 0.62 91.4 87.9 972 28.9 0.68 98.3 95.5 A.M. Tsybulevski et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 85-94 91 nant share of the surface area in alumina falls upon micro- and mesopores and their volume determines catalyst activity. The sulphur accumulates in this same micropore volume of the catalyst where capillary condensation takes place. On the other hand, macropores must provide a transport of the reactants from the external surface of the catalyst deep into the granules and onto the active surface often under conditions when micropores and accessible surface area are partially or totally excluded from the transport system. Thereafter, products of the reaction must also freely egress through the macropore transport system to maintain an efficient equilibrium reaction. Therefore, deactivation of the catalyst in TGTP occurs due to capillary condensation of sulphur in the catalyst micropores and proceeds for two reasons: - a decrease in the efficient magnitude of the area. Hereinafter we shall express the contribution of this factor in terms of the deactivation coefficient, qi = Si/So, equal to the ratio of the current surface area of the catalyst in the ith layer being filled with sulphur at the nth moment of time to the surface area of the fresh catalyst not filled with sulphur; - a decrease in the diffusive permeability of the catalyst. In a catalyst granule filled with sulphur, the transfer of the reactants to the active surface can only take place via macropores. In other words, with a successive flow of the reactants through macro- and micropores the more micropores, are taken out of the transfer system the lower the catalyst permeability. Therefore, the catalyst operation in TGTP is accompanied by a permanent decrease in its efficiency factor ~ expressed in terms of the Thiele module q~ [ 12]. Based on these initial assumptions we obtained the expression for H2S, SO2 breakthrough curves. For example, H2 S concentration equation is: y/= [ y/-_0.4 .~_ 0.4(1 - ~)k(1 - q)r/Rg(P/RT)\"4/Gm]-25 (1) The derivation of equation for hydrogen sulfide concentration immediately below the catalyst layer and definitions assumed are given in Appendix A. Eq. (1) was used in the layered model of the catalyst operation, i.e. it was assumed that each layer one granule high is filled with sulphur in accordance with the Kelvin equation [ 11 ] and only after complete filling of the pore volume in the upper layer capillary condensation of sulphur starts in the next gas-down- flow layer of the catalyst granules. Thus, in the course of the whole operation time of the catalyst, each layer at a given moment of time is characterized by its own parameters, namely, the average radius and the volume of free macro- and micropores, the deactivation degree of the layer, the effective diffusion coeffi- cient of the reactants and the efficiency factor of the catalyst. With a knowledge of the partial pressures of the reactants at the outlet of the layer, it was possible to calculate, by the material balance equation, the partial pressure of sulphur vapours in the ith layer. Then, by the Kelvin equation [11], it was possible to calculate the radius of the pores filled due to capillary condensation in the 1st layer. Accordingly, by means of the pore volume 92 A.M. Tsybulevski et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 85-94 distribution curves, it was also possible to determine the fraction of the total pore volume filled with sulphur V/. The following assumptions were done at the capillary condensation calcula- tions [8]: - the sulphur substances (surface tension, mole volume, equilibrium vapor pressure etc.) in capillary-condensed state are the same as for macrophase bulk sulphur Ss at the preset temperature; - liquid wets in-full pore walls (cos 0 = 1); - pore shape is cylindrical. Thus, integrating Eq. (2) by the length of the layer and by the operation time and referring the obtained concentration of H2S + SO2 to the concentration at the inlet of the converter, it was possible to calculate the conversion degree and similar integration of V/ allows calculation of the catalyst sulphur capacity. Such calculations were made for the chosen samples with the use of the specific data on the radius distribution of the pore volume (Fig. 1) as well as the values of the surface area (Table 1). In Table 3 the values of the sulphur capacity of the samples obtained by such calculation are compared to the respective experimental data. In Fig. 3 the calculated breakthrough curves for H2S for various samples are shown by the solid curves, whereas the results of the experimental measurements are shown as fields of points on the curves and around them. The data presented demonstrate good agreement of the calculated and the experimental data on both the sulphur capacity of the samples and on the conversion degree of H2 S; thus confirming the validity of the notions given here about the mechanism of the catalyst deactivation in TGTP. A catalyst macropore volume increase causes the current efficiency factor to increase and it in turn provides a slower decrease of the reaction rate in the TGTP course when the catalyst is filling with sulphur. Thus, of the two above considered mechanisms of catalysts deactivation in TGTP, one, namely the degree of the catalyst deactivation is responsible primarily for the rate of a sharp conversion drop; whereas the other one, i.e. a change in the efficiency factor, is mainly associated with maintaining the conversion degree at the required level during filling of micropores and is directly responsible for the value of the catalyst sulphur capacity. The curves in Fig. 3 are similar as all the samples have the same volume of micropores. A shift in the starting time of a decrease in the conversion equilibrium degree is due to the increasing fraction of macropores in the catalyst. 5. Conclusions The role of macropores in the catalysts of the sub-dew point Claus tail gas treating processes consists of the provision of reactants efficient mass transfer A.M. Tsybulevski et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 85-94 93 from external surface of catalyst to micropores up to the moment when they are completely filled with sulphur. A very important practical conclusion follows also from this, namely, that the catalyst efficiency in TGTP is determined not only by the relation of micro- and macropore volumes, but in no less degree by the coefficient of their branching, y, equal to the number of micropores that the reactant molecules should go through in order to get from one macropore to another. It is quite clear that at the value of y close to unity an appreciable increase in the catalyst sulphur capacity can be attained. Appendix A. Breakthrough curve equation For the elementary layer of the catalyst with length 'dz' may be written [12]: (1 - e)/~(1 -q)CH:sndzl4 = - GmdYH:s (2) where: e - porosity of the layer; Gm - r/= 3/~ (1/th~o - l/q~) Rg~/k (1 - 0.4 = q)CH2s/Oeff molar gas velocity. (3) (4) where Rg is the radius of granules; Deff is the effective diffusion coefficient; CH2s is the concentration of H2S in gas mixture; k is the rate constant. To determine the effective diffusion coefficient for the model under consider- ation, it is most convenient to make use of the model with a random distribution of pores which was discussed by Wakao and Smith [13]. The diffusion flow in this case is determined as the sum of the flows separately through macro- and micropores and the consecutive flow through both types of pores: Oeff = 02acroOmacro + 02icro(1 + 30macro)/(1 -- 0macro)Omicro (5) where Omacro = 1/((1 -(1 + g2/gl)YHzs)/Ol2 + 1/OK macro); Omicro = 1/((1 --(1 + Ne/N1)YH2s)/D12 + 1/D~ micro); 0micro and 0macro are the pore volume shares of micro and macro pores respectively; DK micro, DK macro are the Knudsen diffusion coefficients in micro- and macropores; Die is the coefficient of molecular diffusion in the gas mixture. YH2s is H2S molar fraction in the gas mixture; N1 and N2 are the diffusion flows of the reactants and the reaction products. The rate constant of the chemical reaction proper was calculated using the kinetic equation obtained by E1 Mastry [14] for the Claus reaction in nongradient conditions: rH2s = 3.537exp(- 35.1/RT)PH2s Ps4 (6) Thus, integrating Eq. (2) and substituting into the solution the deactivation coefficient and the efficiency factor of the catalyst, it would be possible to 94 A.M. Tsybulev ski et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 145 (1996) 85-94 calculate the concentration of the components being removed at the outlet from the infinitely small layer at some moment of time 'h' after the beginning of the run. Such approach resulted in the breakthrough curve Eq. (1) above presented. References [1] H. Fisher, Sulphur, Sulphur Dioxide, Sulfuric Acid, Lurgi, Frankfurt am Main, 1990, pp. 3-21. [2] B.G.

        "dc:description": "The efficiency of 4 samples of alumina catalyst has been studied experimentally in the course of the Claus ‘tail gas’ treating processes at the sulphur sub-dew point (TGTP). The samples were characterized by the same chemical and crystallographic composition, the same volume of micropores, the same surface area and the same catalytic activity but differed appreciably in the volume of macropores. An increase in the effective operation time of the catalysts before breakthrough of unrecoverable sulphur containing compounds, with the increasing macropore volume has been established. A theoretical model of the TGTP has been considered and it has been shown that the increase in the sulphur capacity of the catalysts with a larger volume of macropores is due to an increase in the catalysts efficiency factor and a slower decrease in their diffusive permeability during filling of micropores by sulphur.",
