Graphical abstract Gas-phase catalytic hydrodechlorination is one of the most efficient and economic methods for the removal of volatile chlorinated alkanes. Novel Ag-based bimetallic catalysts with high ethylene selectivities were prepared using the co-impregnation method. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and IR spectroscopy of CO adsorption. The catalytic performance, in particular the selectivities of the catalysts was examined on hydrodechlorination of 1,2-dichloroethane. Two supported monometallic catalysts (Ag/ZrO2 and Pd/ZrO2) were included as comparative catalysts. Ag/ZrO2 exhibited a low 1,2-dichloroethane coversion and high chloroethylene selectivity for the gas-phase hydrodechlorination of 1,2-dichloroethane, while Pd/ZrO2 had a high conversion and ethane selectivity. In contrast to monometallic catalysts, Ag-Pd/ZrO2 with trace Pd had substantially enhanced ethylene selectivity, and the bimetallic catalyst with a Pd loading amount of 0.099wt.% (denoted as Ag(1.99)-Pd(0.099)/ZrO2) exhibited nearly 100% ethylene selectivity. The excellent ethylene selectivity can be attributed to the highly dispersed metallic Pd in Ag particles of Ag(1.99)-Pd(0.099)/ZrO2 as evidenced by the IR spectra of CO adsorption. The findings in this study indicate that Ag-Pd/ZrO2 with trace Pd can be used as promising catalyts for highly effective and selective hydrodechlorination of volatile chlorinated alkanes. Keywords Ag-Pd/ZrO2 catalysts with trace Pd Catalytic hydrodechlorination 1,2-dichloroethane Ethylene selectivity 1 Introduction Volatile chlorinated alkanes, such as 1,2-dichloroethane, were widely used as solvents in large quantities in the chemical and related industries [1,2]. However, their discharge into the atmospheric environment may cause serious health risks as well as ozone-depleting and global warming effects [3,4]. Numerous studies have been devoted to the removal of volatile chlorinated alkanes, and gas-phase catalytic hydrodechlorination is a highly efficient method for the abatement of these contaminants, whereby the contaminants can be transformed into recyclable products [5–15]. In particular, the selective hydrodechlorination of 1,2-dichloroethane has been investigated for the production of ethylene, which is an important raw material in the polymer industry [6–10,14,15]. Supported Pd catalysts have been proven to be highly active for the gas-phase catalytic hydrodechlorination [6–10,13–15]. For the hydrodechlorination of 1,2-dichloroethane, however, these catalysts commonly exhibited low ethylene selectivity [6,7]. Modification of supported Pd catalysts by a second metal (e.g., Ag, Cu, Ni, etc.) may markedly enhance ethylene selectivity [8–10,14–16]. Additionally, deposition of metal or metal oxide on Pd surface was attempted to optimize the modification effects. For example, Kang et al. [17] deposited various transition-metal oxides onto the Pd surface to restrain the formation of exposed Pd ensembles and thus effectively suppress the overhydrogenation of ethylene. Previously, we prepared a core-shell Pd@Ag catalyst using the photocatalytic deposition method, by which the exposed Pd sites mainly presented as isolated ones, giving rise to enhanced ethylene selectivity [15,18]. Notably, the reported Pd-based bimetallic catalysts for the hydrodechlorination of 1,2-dichloroethane commonly contained relatively high Pd contents (e.g., 1.0–2.0wt.%). Accordingly, a substantial amount of second metal had to be used to dilute Pd in order to obtain isolated Pd sites in the catalysts prepared by the impregnation method. For bimetallic catalysts prepared by the selective deposition method, the Pd core was covered by a second metal shell. As a result, only a few Pd sites were exposed as isolate ones, and the majority of Pd did not take part in the catalytic reaction, leading to the waste of expensive noble metal Pd. It should be emphasized that in Pd-based bimetallic catalysts the second metal normally acted the active sites for 1,2-dichloroethane dechlorination, while exposed Pd sites served as the active sites for H2 activation to regenerate the deactivated second metal [8]. Hence, we proposed to prepare bimetallic catalyst with trace Pd, which may effectively avoid the formation of Pd ensembles, and the resulting bimetallic catalyst may exhibit marked ethylene selectivity. To the best of our knowledge, however, no similar catalysts have been reported for the selective hydrodechlorination of 1,2-dichloroethane thus far. The primary objective of this study was to develop novel Pd-based bimetallic catalysts for the selective gas-phase catalytic hydrodechlorination of 1,2-dichloroethane to ethylene, and to illustrate the relationship between selectivity and the structural properties of surface metals. The bimetallic catalyst with trace Pd was prepared using the co-impregnation method. Two monometallic catalysts (Ag/ZrO2 and Pd/ZrO2) were included as comparison. The structural properties of the catalysts were characterized. 2 Experimental 2.1 Catalyst preparation The ZrO2 support was prepared by the precipitation method. Briefly, 2.0M ammonia solution was added dropwise into 300mL of 0.5M ZrOCl2·8H2O aqueous solution under vigorous stirring till pH reached 9.5. After stirring at room temperature for 2h, the resultant precipitant was collected by filtration, followed by repeated washing with distilled water, drying at 105°C for 6h, and then calcining at 400°C in air for 4h. About 11g of ZrO2 was thus obtained with a yield of 71%. The supported monometallic catalysts were prepared by the conventional impregnation method, and bimetallic catalysts with varied metal loadings were prepared by the co-impregnation method. Briefly, ZrO2 was impregnated by Pd(NO3)2 and/or AgNO3 solution under stirring, followed by drying at 110°C for 4h, calcining at 400°C in air for 4h, and then reducing at 400°C in a H2 stream (40mLmin−1) for 3h. The resultant catalysts were denoted as Ag(x)/ZrO2, Ag(x)-Pd(y)/ZrO2 and Pd(y)/ZrO2, where x and y are the metal loading amounts (wt.%). 2.2 Catalyst characterization The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured in the range from 10 to 80° using a Rigaku D/max-RA powder diffractometer (Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan) with Cu Kα radiation (λ=0.15418nm). The UV–vis spectra were collected on a Shimadzu UV-2450 UV/vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan) using BaSO4 as the reference. The Brunauer-Emmer-Teller (BET) surface areas of the samples were determined using the nitrogen adsorption method on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 (Micromeritics Instrument Co., Norcross, GA) at −196°C. Prior to adsorption analysis, the sample was degassed under vacuum at 200°C for 4h. The XPS spectra were collected on a PHI-5000 VersaProbe (ULVAC-PHI Co., Osaka, Japan) equipped with a monochromatized Al Kα X-ray source (hν =1486.6eV) and a hemispherical electron analyzer. The C 1s peak (284.6eV) was used for the calibration of binding energy values. The metal contents in the samples were analyzed using a PerkinElmer Optima 5300 DV (PerkinElmer, USA) inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) system with a radiofrequency power of 1300W. The diffuse reflectance IR spectra of CO adsorption on the samples were measured in a flow IR system using a Bruker Vertex 70v FT-IR spectrometer (Karlsruhe, Germany) equipped with a high-sensitive MCT detector cooled by liquid N2 at 4cm−1 resolution. The DRIFTS cell (Harrick) was fitted with a ZnSe window and a heating cartridge. Briefly, about 10mg of catalyst powder loaded on a sample holder was carefully flattened to enhance IR reflection. The sample was activated in a H2 stream (30mLmin−1) by ramping to 300°C at a rate of 10°Cmin−1 and holding at the temperature for 2h. After cooling to room temperature, the sample was exposed to a CO stream (30mLmin−1) for 30min. After purging with a N2 stream (30mLmin−1) for 30min, IR spectra were recorded. 2.3 Gas-phase catalytic hydrodechlorination of 1,2-dichloroethane The gas-phase catalytic hydrodechlorination of 1,2-dichloroethane was carried out in a continuous down-flow glass reactor with a quartz frit at 270°C under atmospheric pressure. Briefly, 100mg of catalyst was pressed into wafers, broken into small platelets, sieved to 20–40mesh, and then loaded on a quartz frit. The gas streams with constant flow rates were metered by mass flow controllers and were mixed before entering the reactor. Prior to the reaction test, the catalyst was in-situ reduced in a H2 stream (40mLmin−1) at 400°C for 2h. After cooling in H2 to 270°C, the H2 stream was switched to a mixed gas flow (He and H2, 42mLmin−1), to which 1,2-dichloroethane was injected at 0.059mLh−1 using a microprocessor-controlled infusion pump. The flow consisted of 7300ppm of 1,2-dichloroethane, 36,800ppm of H2, and a balance of He. The analysis of the reaction products was performed using an online GC 3420A (Beifen-Ruili Co., Beijing, China) equipped with a packed column of Propark Q and a flame-ionization detector (FID). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalyst characterization The bulk loadings and superficial atomic concentrations of the metals in the supported catalysts are summarized in Table 1 . The actual loading, if applied, was approximately 2.0wt.% for Ag, and 0.098% to 0.30wt.% for Pd in test catalysts. Given the identical Ag loading, the superficial atomic concentrations of Ag in the catalysts decreased from 1.02 to 0.79% with the increase of Pd loading from 0 to 0.30wt.%, implying that Pd was successfully integrated into the Ag particles. On the other hand, it also indicated the increased exposed concentration of Pd with Pd loading level. However, the accurate Pd superficial concentration was not available due to its low loading (<0.3wt.%) and partial overlap of Pd 3d5/2 with Zr 3p3/2 [19,20]. In addition to the reduced atomic concentration, the chemical state of superficial Ag was also affected by Pd loading amount, as reflected by the XPS Ag 3d spectra of the catalysts (Fig. 1 and Table 1). For Ag(2.01)/ZrO2, the binding energy of the Ag core line 3d5/2 was observed at 368.2eV, indicative of the presence of metallic Ag [21,22]. In comparison with Ag(2.01)/ZrO2, the Ag 3d5/2 peak in the Ag-Pd/ZrO2 samples shifted to lower binding energy, reflecting the formation of cationic Ag species. Such an electron effect could be ascribed to the charge redistribution between metallic Ag and Pd due to the higher electronegativity of Pd than Ag [23–26]. Notably, the electron effect would occur only if metallic Pd and Ag were in intimate contact, suggesting that Ag-Pd alloy was formed in the bimetallic catalysts [27]. The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra of different catalysts are presented in Fig. 2 . All catalysts exhibited a strong absorption peak around 220nm, assigned to the ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) from O2− to Zr4+ in crystalline ZrO2 [28,29]. An additional absorbance peak was observed at 500nm on Ag(2.01)/ZrO2, characteristic of the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect from metallic Ag particles [30,31]. As for Ag(1.99)-Pd(0.099)/ZrO2, the SPR absorption peak of metallic Ag blue-shifted to around 400nm, and was remarkably weakened, reflecting the formation of small Ag ensembles upon Pd loading [31]. The SPR absorption of Ag particles was almost disappeared when the Pd loading was further increased to 0.30wt.%. These observations were consistent with the formation of Ag-Pd alloys as suggested by XPS data. The XRD patterns of the supported catalysts are shown in Fig. S1. For ZrO2, diffraction peaks with 2θ at 24.4, 28.3, 31.5, 34.6, 49.3, 54.1 and 55.5° assigned to monoclinic ZrO2 phase, and 30.6, 35.8 50.2, and 59.9° corresponding to tetragonal phase were observed [32]. As for ZrO2 supported catalysts, the diffraction peaks characteristic of metallic Pd or/and Ag were not identified, likely due to the low metal loading amounts or/and high metal dispersions. IR spectra of CO adsorption on the catalysts provide more information regarding the species and structures of the surface metals (results presented in Fig. 3 ). For Ag(2.01)/ZrO2, no IR band was observed in the range of 1800–2200cm−1, reflecting that CO was incapable of adsorbing on the surface of metallic Ag [33,34]. On the contrary, strong CO adsorption was identified on Pd containing catalysts. For Pd(0.098)/ZrO2, a weak IR band at 2081cm−1 and a strong band at 1927cm−1 were observed, assigned to linear and bridged CO adsorption, respectively [33,35]. In comparison with monometallic catalysts, very different IR spectra of CO adsorption were observed on the bimetallic catalysts. For Ag(1.99)-Pd(0.099)/ZrO2, only a strong IR band was observed at 2048cm−1, characteristic of linear CO adsorption. The absence of bridged CO absorbance in the range of 2000–1900cm−1 indicated that in Ag(1.99)-Pd(0.099)/ZrO2 isolated Pd sites were dominant. In comparison with Pd(0.098)/ZrO2, a markedly red shift of the linear CO adsorption was identified in Ag(1.99)-Pd(0.099)/ZrO2 due to the decreased dipole-dipole interaction between adsorbed CO [36,37], further confirming the presence of isolated Pd sites. Increasing Pd loading level in the bimetallic catalysts led to increased intensity of the IR band at 2048cm−1 and gradual development of a new IR band at 1960cm−1, assigned to two-fold bonded bridged CO adsorption. The presence of two-fold bonded bridged CO adsorption suggested gradual formation of small Pd ensembles. Furthermore, the increased intensity of IR bands at 2064 and 1960cm−1 revealed the increased concentration of exposed Pd sites in the bimetallic catalysts with increasing Pd loading amount. 3.2 Gas-phase catalytic hydrodechlorination of 1,2-dichloroethane The gas-phase catalytic hydrodechlorination of 1,2-dichloroethane over the two monometallic catalysts, Ag(2.01)/ZrO2 and Pd(0.098)/ZrO2, is shown in Fig. 4 . For hydrodechlorination catalyzed by Ag(2.01)/ZrO2, only chloroethylene and ethylene were identified as the hydrogenation products (Fig. 4a). Even at early time on stream (TOS) ethane was not detected, reflecting that supported Ag catalyst was not capable of catalyzing the hydrogenation of ethylene to ethane. The catalytic activity of Ag(2.01)/ZrO2 was very low (as reflected by 1.77% of initial conversion of 1,2-dichloroethane, Table 2 ), and gradually decreased with TOS. Additionally, the ethylene selectivity decreased with TOS (from 49.62% initially to 29.38% at steady state). The low 1,2-dichloroethane conversion of Ag(2.01)/ZrO2 was due to the low hydrogenation capability of metallic Ag, and the gradual deactivation of the catalyst could be attributed to the formation of the stable Ag-Cl specie on the surface of Ag particles (e.g., chlorine poisoning) [8,15]. In line with this, the chlorine content in the fresh Ag(2.01)/ZrO2 catalyst was below the detection limit, while increased to 13.91wt.% after hydrodechlorination (see Table 1). Due to the chlorine poisoning, isolated Ag sites gradually dominated with TOS, which suppressed the simultaneous dissociation of the two CCl bonds of 1,2-dichloroethane, thus resulted in gradually increased production of chloroethylene and finally decreased ethylene selectivity. The results also implied that the suppression of the deactivation of exposed Ag sites probably played a crucial role in the selective hydrodechlorination of 1,2-dichloroethane to ethylene. Compared with supported metallic Ag, Pd exhibited a higher catalytic activity for the hydrodechlorination of 1,2-dichloroethane. Despite the lower metal content, the initial conversion of 1,2-dichloroethane on Pd(0.098)/ZrO2 (19.3%) was much higher than that of Ag(2.01)/ZrO2 (1.77%). Moreover, ethane was detected as the predominant product (>91.03%) at early TOS in hydrodechlorination catalyzed by Pd(0.098)/ZrO2, along with minor products of ethylene, propane, butane, and chloroethane (<8.97%, Fig. 4b). The very high ethane selectivity of Pd(0.098)/ZrO2 could be ascribed to the presence of contiguous Pd sites, favoring the overhydrogenation of ethylene to ethane via the formation of di-σCH2–CH2 intermediate on the surface of Pd ensembles [38]. However, deactivation also occurred to Pd(0.098)/ZrO2. The chlorine content of Pd(0.098)/ZrO2 increased to 12.70wt.% after use (Table 1). Consequently, the 1,2-dichloroethane conversion decreased from 19.3 to 4.57% after 40h on stream. Similar deactivation of supported Pd catalysts in hydrodechlorination reaction due to the poisoning of Pd sites by chlorine was previously observed [38–40]. Additionally, deposition of carbonaceous species on Pd surface was also responsible for the deactivation of the catalysts [41]. Notably, due to the gradual formation of isolated Pd sites on the catalyst resulting from chlorine poisoning and carbonaceous deposits [15,41–43], the ethylene selectivity of Pd(0.098)/ZrO2 slightly increased with TOS at the expense of ethane selectivity. Very different catalytic performance was observed on bimetallic Ag-Pd/ZrO2 catalysts for the hydrodechlorination of 1,2-dichloroethane (results presented in Fig. 5 ). The initial activity of Ag(1.99)-Pd(0.099)/ZrO2 was 6.07%, higher than that of Ag(2.01)/ZrO2, but lower than that of Pd(0.098)/ZrO2. It should be noted that Pd sites in Ag(1.99)-Pd(0.099)/ZrO2 existed as isolated ones due to their high dispersion in the bulk and on the surface of Ag particles, as evidenced by the IR spectra of CO adsorption. Additionally, the isolated Pd sites acted as catalytic sites for H2 activation to regenerate Ag sites [8]. Hence, despite nearly identical Pd content, Ag(1.99)-Pd(0.099)/ZrO2 exhibited lower activity than that of Pd(0.098)/ZrO2. In contrast, owing to the effective regeneration of Ag sites poisoned by chlorine, the catalytic activity of Ag(1.99)-Pd(0.098)/ZrO2 was much higher than that of Ag(2.01)/ZrO2. With the increase of Pd loading, however, small Pd ensembles with contiguous Pd atoms gradually formed, and those Pd ensembles contributed to the conversion of 1,2-dichloroethane, giving rising to increased catalyst activity. Consistently, the initial activity of Ag(2.01)-Pd(0.30)/ZrO2 increased to 26.92%, much higher than that of Ag(1.99)-Pd(0.099)/ZrO2. The advantages of Ag-Pd/ZrO2 with trace Pd could be better demonstrated in terms of substantially enhanced ethylene selectivity. As shown in Fig. 5a, Ag(1.99)-Pd(0.099)/ZrO2 exhibited nearly a 100% ethylene selectivity throughout the test TOS, which was more stable and significantly higher than the respective selectivity of Ag(2.01)/ZrO2 (49.62% initially and 29.38% at steady stage) and Pd(0.098)/ZrO2 (0.69% initially and 5.85% at steady stage). The selectivity of Ag(1.99)-Pd(0.099)/ZrO2 is also better than some similar Pd-based bimetallic catalysts (under similar reaction conditions) reported in literature. For example, Lambert et al. prepared a series of Pd-Ag/SiO2 by diluting Pd (1.50wt.%) with Ag (0–3.0wt.%), and found that Pd(1.5)-Ag(3.0) exhibited a highest ethylene selectivity of 96.0% at the reaction temperature of 250°C [8]. Recently, a core-shell Pd@Ag/TiO2 was applied for 1,2-dichloroethane hydrodechlorination, and its ethylene selectivity was 66.1% and 88.0% at the initial and steady stage [15], respectively. However, the above bimetallic catalysts contained much higher Pd contents (e.g. 1.0–2.0wt.%) than that in this work. Srebowata et al. [10] reported a Pd-Ni/C catalyst containing low Pd content (0.1wt.%), and its steady ethylene selectivity was found to be only 79.3%. The excellent ethylene selectivity of Ag(1.99)-Pd(0.099)/ZrO2 can be attributed to the high dispersion of metallic Pd in the catalysts. As reflected by IR spectra of CO adsorption, Pd sites in Ag(1.99)-Pd(0.099)/ZrO2 were presented as isolated ones, and serviced as active sites for H2 activation and regeneration of Ag sites. Therefore, the overhydrogenation of ethylene to ethane was prevented due to the absence of contiguous Pd sites. In addition, the formation of isolated Ag sites by chlorine poisoning during the hydrodechlorination process could be avoided, and the partial hydrodechlorination of 1,2-dichloroethane to chloroethylene was thus effectively suppressed. It is worth noting that the ethylene selectivity of the bimetallic catalyst was closely correlated to Pd loading level. The initial ethylene selectivity was about 100% for Ag(1.99)-Pd(0.099)/ZrO2, 91.51% for Ag(1.97)-Pd(0.15)/ZrO2, 71.84% for Ag(2.03)-Pd(0.20)/ZrO2, and 30.06% for Ag(2.01)-Pd(0.30)/ZrO2, indicative of a decreased ethylene selectivity with Pd loading level. Such a Pd loading level dependent ethylene selectivity could be well explained in terms of the ensemble effect of the bimetallic catalyst. IR spectra of CO adsorption revealed that at Pd loading level above 0.099wt.%, small Pd ensembles with contiguous Pd sites were formed. Additionally, the content of small Pd ensembles increased with Pd loading level. Those Pd ensembles favored the overhydrogenation of ethylene to ethane [39,40], giving rise to decreased ethylene selectivity. Moreover, for the bimetallic catalysts with Pd loading level above 0.15, the ethylene selectivity increased with TOS at the expense of ethane selectivity, and finally reached a steady selectivity higher than 95%. This could be likely ascribed to the gradual conversion of small Pd ensembles into isolated Pd sites due to chlorine deposition on Pd particle surface. 4 Conclusion In the present study, Ag-Pd/ZrO2 catalysts with varied Pd loading levels were prepared and the gas phase catalytic HDC of 1,2-dichloroethane over the catalysts was investigated. The results indicate that cationic Ag species are formed in Ag-Pd/ZrO2 due to the higher electronegativity of Pd than that of Ag. For Ag-Pd/ZrO2 with Pd content below 0.099wt.% exposed Pd sites exist as isolated ones, whereas small Pd ensembles with adjacent Pd sites present at Pd loading level above 0.099wt.%. In the gas phase HDC of 1,2-dichloroethane, Ag(2.01)/ZrO2 exhibits a high chloroethylene selectivity, and the chloroethylene selectivity increased with TOS, due to the formation of isolated Ag sites. However, Pd(0.098)/ZrO2 displays high conversion and ethane selectivity. On the contrary, Ag-Pd/ZrO2 had substantially enhanced ethylene selectivity, and ethylene selectivity strongly depended on Pd loading level. Increasing Pd loading level leads to increased ethane selectivity in the expense of ethylene selectivity, which is attributed to the formation of small Pd ensembles with adjacent Pd sites. Findings in this study highlight the potential of Ag-Pd/ZrO2 with trace Pd as highly selective catalysts for the gas phase HDC of 1,2-dichloroethane to ethylene.

        "dc:description": "Gas-phase catalytic hydrodechlorination is one of the most efficient and economic methods for the removal of volatile chlorinated alkanes. Novel Ag-based bimetallic catalysts with high ethylene selectivities were prepared using the co-impregnation method. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and IR spectroscopy of CO adsorption. The catalytic performance, in particular the selectivities of the catalysts was examined on hydrodechlorination of 1,2-dichloroethane. Two supported monometallic catalysts (Ag/ZrO2 and Pd/ZrO2) were included as comparative catalysts. Ag/ZrO2 exhibited a low 1,2-dichloroethane coversion and high chloroethylene selectivity for the gas-phase hydrodechlorination of 1,2-dichloroethane, while Pd/ZrO2 had a high conversion and ethane selectivity. In contrast to monometallic catalysts, Ag-Pd/ZrO2 with trace Pd had substantially enhanced ethylene selectivity, and the bimetallic catalyst with a Pd loading amount of 0.099wt.% (denoted as Ag(1.99)-Pd(0.099)/ZrO2) exhibited nearly 100% ethylene selectivity. The excellent ethylene selectivity can be attributed to the highly dispersed metallic Pd in Ag particles of Ag(1.99)-Pd(0.099)/ZrO2 as evidenced by the IR spectra of CO adsorption. The findings in this study indicate that Ag-Pd/ZrO2 with trace Pd can be used as promising catalyts for highly effective and selective hydrodechlorination of volatile chlorinated alkanes.",
