Image, graphical abstract Introduction The catalytic synthesis of various kinds of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and other fine chemicals through selective hydrogenation of functionalized quinolines was one of the most vital tools in fine chemical industry [1]. For example, angustureine, virantmycin, aspernigerin, and other chemicals [2], all contain 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolines (py-THQ) units. In the past decades, the catalytic cyclization [3], Beckman rearrangement [4], and selective hydrogenation of N-heterocycles have been adopted for the preparation of py-THQ derivatives. Among the reported methods, the catalytic hydrogenation of readily accessible quinolines offers a straightforward and promising way to access py-THQ in terms of its simplicity and high atom efficiency [5]. Compared with other hydrogen donors, H2 represents the green and sustainable hydrogen source for the catalytic hydrogenation of quinolines into py-THQ, because of 100% atomic efficiency, while the use of other hydrogen donors not only delivers low atom efficiency, it also results in the formation of by-products. For example, the use of formic acid and alcohols as the hydrogen donor sometimes produce N-formamide [6] and N-alkylated py-THQ derivatives [ 7 ], respectively. As far as the catalytic hydrogenation of quinolines into py-THQ by H2, many catalytic methods have been documented. Homogeneous catalysts such as Ru [8], Ir [9], Rh [10], and Au [11] complexes have been well established. However, their excellent performance was accompanied with difficult catalysts separation and recovery. These issues can be resolved by heterogeneous catalysts. Precious heterogeneous catalysts such as Pt [12], Pd, [13] Ru [14], Ir [15], Rh [16], and AuPd [17] have received substantial interest owing to their excellent performance. These reported catalytic systems were commonly worked with high hydrogen pressures (1–4 MPa), temperatures (50–150 °C) or long reaction time (>10 h), oftentimes leaded to substrates over-reduction. Moreover, this catalysis system is not satisfactory for functionalized quinolines, such as nitriles, amines, and halogens. Recently, inexpensive metal (such as Fe, [18] Co [19], Ni [20]) based catalysts have been developed for the catalytic hydrogenation of quinolines into py-THQ. Due to the intrinsic low activity of the non-noble metal catalysts, harsh reaction conditions were required for the non-noble metal catalysts. Obviously, the use of explosive H2 under harsh reaction conditions have the safety issues. In addition, the use of expensive organic ligands during the preparation of the catalyst, long term costing of the reaction, and the slight deactivation observed during the recovery experiments have limited its industrial application. Therefore, the aim of this work is to develop a novel high-performance heterogeneous catalyst in selective hydrogenation of quinolines. In our group, we have successfully prepared a series of nitrogen-doped carbon materials stabilized metal catalysts for the catalytic oxidation and reduction reactions [21]. We have discovered that the nitrogen-atoms could effectively stabilize the metal nanoparticles and the nitrogen atoms serve as the base site to assist the metal sites to promote the chemical reactions. Herein, the nitrogen-doped carbon supported Ru nanoparticles with ultra-size in 7 nm were successfully prepared and used for mild and selective hydrogenation of quinolines into py-THQ. Experimental section Materials Dicyandiamide, RuCl3•xH2O, Vulcan XC72R and all substrates were purchased from Aladdin Chemicals Co. Ltd (Beijing, China). All the solvents were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The reagents used in the reaction and catalyst preparation were commercially available and were not further purified. Synthesis of Ru@NC-T catalyst The synthesis of catalysts is based on the previous literature [22] with some modifications. Briefly, Ruthenium (III) chloride hydrate (0.15 mmol, 30 mg) and dicyanamide (200 mg) were dissolved in 50 ml ethanol and stirred for 2 h at 60 °C. Then, Vulcan XC72R was added and the suspension was stirred at 60 °C for another 2 h. After that, the mixture was subjected to rotary evaporation and dried in vacuo at 60 °C overnight. The dried sample was subsequently pyrolyzed at 400, 500, 600 or 700 °C for 2 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. The final catalysts were marked as Ru@NC-T, T labels the pyrolysis temperature. Characterization The Ru@NC-T catalysts were characterized using a series of analytical techniques. These Characterizations were described as follows, The X-ray powder diffraction pattern (XRD) was measured using an XD6 type polycrystalline X-ray diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation as an X-ray source. The specific surface area and pore structure of the catalysts were measured on a Micromeritics ASAP-2010 physical adsorption instrument. The BET surface areas and pore size distributions of the samples were measured by N2 sorption isotherms (77 K) and the BJH model with the Micromeritics ASAP-2010 physical adsorption apparatus. XPS was performed on the Thermo ESCALAB 250 XI spectrometer with an Al Kα (hν=1486.6 eV) X-ray source. All binding energies were calibrated with the C1s peak at 284.8 eV for the adventitious carb. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on JEOL JEM-2000 FX microscope at 200 kV. To prepare the TEM sample, a small amount of catalyst was ultrasonically dispersed in ethanol. A drop of such suspension was dropped onto a 200 mesh Cu grid. Catalyst test A typical experiment of hydrogenation of quinoline over Ru@NC-T catalysts was described according the literature report. 58.8 ul quinoline (0.5 mmol), 20 mg Ru/NC-T catalyst, and 10 ml solvent were added into an autoclave reactor, subsequently purged with H2 five times at 10 bar, and pressurized to 20 bar H2. The reaction was operated at 30 °C and then stirred at 1000 rpm for 4 h. After the reaction was completed, ethyl benzene (70 ul) was then added in the reaction system as an internal standard, and the reaction products were analyzed using Agilent 7890A equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a 60 m capillary column (HP-5) and with high purity nitrogen as the carrier gas. Results and discussion The schematic diagram of the fabrication process of these catalysts was listed in Fig. 1 , which was simple and reproduced. Briefly, the carbon support was first homogeneously mixed with dicyanamide and RuCl3, and then subjected to the pyrolysis at 400∼700 °C. The as-prepared catalysts were assigned as Ru@NC-T, where T represents the pyrolysis temperature. as During the pyrolysis process, the nitrogen atoms were doped into the carbon framework, and the Ru3+ cations were reduced to Ru nanoparticles by the in-situ formed reducing gasses. To understanding more details about the properties of these Ru@NC-T catalysts, physicochemical characterizations of these catalysts were investigated. The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77 K and pore size distribution of Ru@NC-400, Ru@NC-500, and Ru@NC-600 catalysts are demonstrated in Figure S1. These isotherms are close to type I, which is defined by the BDDT (Brunauer- Deming-Teller) classification. The t-Plot micropore areas of the samples were calculated to be 117.8 m2/g, 132.0 m2/g, and 130.6 m2/g for Ru@NC-400, Ru@NC-500, and Ru@NC-600, respectively. (Table S1). The weight percentage of Ru in the Ru@NC-500 catalyst was determined to be 3.6% ICP-AES, and the Ru@NC-400 and Ru@NC-600 showed similar loading results. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and High-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) were used to characterize the Ru species in the as-prepared Ru@NC-T catalysts (Fig. 2 ). TEM images of Ru@NC-T catalysts confirmed the presence of essentially monodispersed Ru particles of Ru@NC-400 (Figure S2) and the presence of essentially Ru particles of mean diameter 8.9 nm of Ru@NC-700 (Fig. 2C), respectively. As can be seen Fig. 2A and 2B, the Ru NPs are well dispersed in the NC framework and the size of Ru@NC-500 and Ru@NC-600 have a narrow distribution in average size of 6.8 nm and 7.7 nm. HRTEM images (Figure (a), (b), and (c)) show that Ru NPs over both Ru@NC-500, Ru@NC-600 and Ru@NC-700 samples present the same hexagonal Ru lattice with a Ru (101) interlayer spacing of 0.20 nm. The surface properties of these Ru@NC-T catalysts were probe by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. 3 and Table S3). The Ru 2p3/2 peaks with binding energies of 462.8, 462.9, and 462.5 eV were observed for Ru@NC-500, Ru@NC-600, and Ru@NC-700, respectively. The binding energies of the Ru 2p3/2 peak around 462 eV can be assigned to the metallic Ru (0) species. In addition, the coexistence of Ru 3p3/2 (IV) in Ru@NC-T catalysts were observed on the main peak around 464 eV (Fig. S6 and Table S2). The binding energies of Ru (IV) 3p in the Ru@NC-500 catalyst is 464.9 eV, which was much larger than that of Ru@NC-400 (464.3 eV) and Ru@NC-600 (464.4 eV) catalysts because of the interaction between Ru nanoparticle and nitrogen-doped-carbon. In a preliminary study, screening catalysts for the hydrogenation of quinoline with H2 were explored. As showed in Table 1 , the pyrolysis temperature presented a great influence on the catalytic performance of the Ru@NC-T catalysts. Ru@NC-400 gave no conversion, and the conversion was only 33.4% over the Ru@NC-700 catalyst (Table 1, entries 1 & 4), suggesting that the low or high pyrolysis temperatures were gone against for quinoline hydrogenation. Ru/NC-500 exhibited the highest catalytic activity with respect to 86.6% conversion, whereas Ru/NC-600 produced a lower conversion of 49.6% under same conditions (Table 1, entry 2 vs entry 3). As far as the catalytic hydrogenation activity of metal nanoparticles, it is depended on the size of metallic nanoparticles. Generally speaking, the catalytic activity of metallic nanoparticles decreased with an increase of the size of metallic nanoparticles [23], as the metallic nanoparticles with large size provide fewer active sites to contact with H2 and the substrates. On the meanwhile, the metallic nanoparticles with too small size were also not beneficial for the catalytic hydrogenation reactions [24]. For example, the polyer-resin supported Pt nanoparticles with size in 0.7 nm demonstrated much lower catalytic activity than the catalysts with Pt nanoparticles in 7∼13 nm for the same reaction of the hydrogenation of quinoline [25]. As Ru was in metallic states for all the as-prepared Ru@NC-T catalysts, thus the reason for the invisible activity of Ru@NC-400 catalyst should be caused by its ultra-small size of Ru cluster. The inactivity of Ru@NC-400 Ru cluster resulted the preferable adsorption of quinoline to block the sites for the activation of H2 molecules. The decrease of the catalytic activity of the Ru@NC-T from 500 to 700 °C was due to the increase of the size of Ru nanoparticles. In addition, no conversion was observed over the metal-free NC-500 catalyst (Table 1, entry 6), suggesting that metallic Ru nanoparticles were active site for the hydrogenation of quinoline. The Ru/C-500 was also prepared by the first impregnation of RuCl3 and the subsequent reduction by H2 at 500 °C. TEM images revealed that metallic Ru nanoparticles with a small size in 4.2 nm. These results suggested that the nitrogen atoms in the carbon material played a role in the stabilization of Ru nanoparticles. Ru/C-500 showed much lower activity than the Ru@NC-500 (Table 1, entries 2 vs 5). Besides the smaller particle size in Ru/C-500, the absence of nitrogen atoms in the catalyst should also be one of the reasons for the low activity of Ru@NC-500. On the one hand, the nitrogen atoms should enhance the activity of metallic Ru nanoparticles via the electronic interaction by denoting electrons from nitrogen atoms to Ru nanoparticles [26]. On the other hand, the nitrogen might server as the base sites to promote the heterolytic cleavage of H2 molecules over metallic Ru sites. To supports the role of nitrogen atom in the assist with Ru. The reaction was also performed in the presence of acetic acid, and the activity of Ru@NC-500 indeed decreased (Table 1, Entry 7). It is worth noting that 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline selectivity was >99% for all cases without the hydrogenation of aromatic ring. Quinoline hydrogenation was then performed under different conditions over the Ru@NC-500 catalyst. The reaction solvents showed a great influence on the catalytic hydrogenation of quinoline. High 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline selectivity (>99%) were produced in most tested solvents after 4 h at 30 °C and under a H2 pressure of 2 MPa (Table 2 , entries 2–3 and entries 6–10). No conversion can proceed in these strong polar solvents dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), and 1,4-dioxane over Ru@NC-500 catalyst (Table 2, entries 1 & 2). Poor conversions were observed in the hydrocarbon solvents such as hexane and toluene (Table 2, entries 3 & 4). Moderate conversions were produced in tetrahydrofuran (THF)and dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) (Table 2, entries 5 & 6). Alcohols are highly desirable solvents because it is cheap, nontoxic, and environmentally benign. So, ethanol and isopropanol were also used for the hydrogenation of quinoline at 30 °C and under a H2 pressure of 2 MPa. To our great pleasure, isopropanol and ethanol gave high conversions in 89.6% and 99.6% after 4 h at 30 °C and 2 MPa H2 (Table 2, entries 7 & 8), respectively. The reaction was sensitive to the hydrogen pressure (Table S2). The conversion greatly increased from 24.0% after 4 h at 30 °C and 1 bar H2 pressure to 81.8% at 5 bar H2 pressure. The reason should be due to the great increase of H2 concentration the polar ethanol solvent with an increase of H2 pressure. After 5 h, the quantitative conversion of quinoline to 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline was obtained at 30 °C and 1 MPa H2. The functional group tolerance survey of various quinoline derivatives was conducted over the Ru@NC-500 catalyst and the results were summarized in Fig. 4 . Generally, the position of the substituted groups in the aromatic ring showed no significant influence on the substrate activity (Fig. 4, 1a & 2a, 7a &12a and 9a &10a). However, the position of the substituted groups in the N-heterocyclic ring showed a great influence on the substrate activity. The 2-methyl substituted substrates were much less active, and the high reaction temperature at 50 °C was required to get high yields (Fig. 4, 14a). For example, the conversion in the hydrogenation of 2-methylquinoline at 50 °C produced 87.3% conversion after 12 h, while the conversion of 6-methylquinoline and 8-methylquinoline were beyond 91% at 30 °C after 8 h, respectively (Fig. 4, 1a, 2a & 3a). The lower activity of the 2-substitued group in quinoline was due to the large steric hindrance, as the reaction starts by the adsorption of quinolines on the Ru nanoparticles. The steric hindrance was also observed for the substrate 7,8-benzoquinoline. In addition, the hydrogenation at 50 °C resulted in the partial hydrogenation of the aromatic ring. The electronic properties of the substituted groups also showed some influence on the substrate activity. Substrates with the electron-donating -OH and -NH2 groups were less active, which were performed at 50 °C to get high yields (Fig. 4, 10a & 11a). The Ru@NC-500 catalyst showed a good tolerance to many functional groups, demonstrating a promising potential in the practical application. Ru@NC-500 also exhibited good activity in the hydrogenation of 6- substitute quinoline (-Cl, -Br, -OMe, -OH, -COOH), 7- substitute quinoline (-Cl, -Br) and 8-hydroxyquinoline, affording a ca. 100% selectivity to the corresponding 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolines except for 6‑methoxy-quinoline (entries 6–14). Moreover, to investigate the high selectivity of the catalytic system, the hydrogenation of quinoxaline was test and little benzene ring hydrogenation occurred. And the selectivity to 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxaline is 95.1%. Conclusion In summary, a highly efficient method has been developed for the selective hydrogenation of quinolines over a Ru@NC-500 catalyst. The size of metallic Ru nanoparticles was discovered to be highly important for the hydrogenation of quinolines. Ru@NC-500 with an appropriate size exhibited an extremely high catalytic activity and selectivity toward the reduction of quinoline compounds. Under mild conditions, substituted quinolines were successfully hydrogenated into the corresponding 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolines. In addition, the nitrogen atoms in the support played a role in the stabilization of Ru nanoparticle as well as the assistance with Ru nanoparticles for the activation of H2 molecules. The utility of the Ru@NC-500 catalyst opens new avenues for the selective hydrogenation of a broad spectrum of quinoline compounds to provide novel sustainable platform chemicals.
