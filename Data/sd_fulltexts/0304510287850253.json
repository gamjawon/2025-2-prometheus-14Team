FU, H. H. RUNG and W. M. H. SACHTLER Ipatieff Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60201 (U.S.A.) (Received December 9, 1986; accepted May 18,1987) Summary After poisoning with pyridine, tartaric acid-modified Ni catalysts showed an unexpected behavior as regards the dependence of enantioselec- tivity on the reaction temperature. While in the absence of a poison the enantioselectivity decreased with increasing reaction temperature, it re- mained constant for pyridine-poisoned Ni catalysts. This phenomenon is tentatively explained by assuming that ligand water is replaced by pyridine ligands in the Ni-tartrate complexes on the nickel surface. As pyridine is strongly held by Ni2\"1\" ions, a higher ligand rigidity is attained which keeps the selectivity of the catalyst constant. Introduction Supported and unsupported Ni catalyst modified with (.R,.R)-tartaric acid catalyzes the enantioselective hydrogenation of methyl acetoacetate (MAA) to methyl 3-hydroxybutyrate (MHB). The enantioselectivity of the catalyst can be changed by varying the modification conditions, such as temperature, time, concentration of modifier, pH and the addition of co- modifiers [1 - 5]. The selective sites which are created during modification are believed to be some nickel tartrate complexes on the surface [6]. In addi- tion to modification conditions, reaction conditions can also affect enantio- selectivity. For example, there is an optimum temperature for the enantio- selective hydrogenation of MAA. Above this temperature (55 C for gas- phase hydrogenation of MAA), the selectivity of the catalyst decreases with increasing reaction temperature. It has even been reported that at higher reaction temperature the rotation sign of the product is reversed for some amino acid-modified catalysts [7, 8]. The simultaneous presence of selective and non-selective sites on the surface of a modified catalyst leaves two possibilities for improving the selec- tivity of modified catalysts: either the non-selective sites are predominantly poisoned, or the intrinsic selectivity of the selective sites is increased. Differ- 0304-5102/87/$3.60 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 188 ent alkali halides have been used as co-modifiers or promoters. Some authors believe that their function is to poison the non-selective sites on the surface [9]. Other data indicate, however, that halide ions occupy coordination sites of the nickel tartrate complex and thus increase the intrinsic selectivity of the selective sites. An argument for this view is that enantioselectivity has been increased by halides in some cases without lowering the activity of the catalyst, as would have expected if site blocking were dominating [10]. Pyri- dine, butylamine and ammonia were also used as poisons because of their strong adsorption on Ni metal. In the liquid-phase hydrogenation of MAA, they were always found to improve the enantioselectivity while decreasing the activity of the catalyst [11]. Apparently all additives co-modifiers, promoters or poisons possess the ability to interact with Ni metal atoms and with Ni tartrate complexes. In the case of liquid-phase reactions in a static reactor, these additives can stay on the surface, become desorbed or re-adsorbed at other sites. In the case of gas-phase hydrogenation, however, desorption will be more endo- thermic and thus less favorable; but if it occurs under flow conditions, it will be irreversible. Therefore we decided to study the gas-phase hydrogenation in a flow reactor at various temperatures for modified Ni catalysts, with or without pretreatment with butylamine or pyridine. Experimental The preparation of the catalyst, its reduction and modification were described in a previous paper [12]. Catalysts were reduced with the TPR method. The catalysts were modified at room temperature and 100 C with a 2 wt.% tartaric acid solution adjusted with NaOH to pH 5. After modification, 0.5 g of the catalyst was soaked in a solution of 2 ml pyridine (or butylamine) and 60 ml MeOH for about 30 min. The catalyst was then washed with 50 ml MeOH and transferred into the reactor under the protection of MeOH. The hydrogenation was performed in two gas-phase reaction systems. The MAA saturators in the two systems were at 11 and 25 C, which pro- vided MAA vapor pressures of 0.34 and 1.03 Torr, respectively. Each product collection lasted about 30 h. After each collection, the reaction temperature was changed and the product was collected again. Results Table 1 and curve 1 in Fig. 1 show the results for a modified Ni catalyst. The selectivity depends on the reaction temperature, as expected [1]. A maximum selectivity of 18.6% was found at 55 C. The entry order of the data in the table is the same as that of product collection. After the reaction 189 TABLE 1 Temperature dependence of selectivity for a modified Ni catalyst'1 Reaction Conversion e.e. temperature (%) (%) ( C) 55 93.9 18.6 2.9 42 89.4 15.1 2.8 82 96.7 10.9 3.9 105 98.6 2.2 3.0 114 98.4 1.7 2.3 55 92.0 4.9 2.2 \"Catalyst: Ni/SiOz; modification: 100 ml 2 wt.% tartaric acid (pH 5) at room tempera- ture for 13 h; reaction conditions: H^ flow rate: 100 ml min~1, MAA saturator tempera- ture: 11 C, PMAA = 0.34 Torr, wt. of catalyst = 0.5124 g.

This indi- cates that part of the loss in the selectivity after heating is irreversible. Tables 2 and 3 show the results for butylamine- and pyridine-poisoned catalysts that were modified at room temperature.

However, it did not change with increasing reaction temperature. This is clearly seen when the data in Table 3 are plotted in curve 2 in Fig. 1. Only above 110 'C did the selectivity decrease slightly, and decomposition of the tartrate was observed. A similar much weaker temperature depen- dence of selectivity after pyridine poisoning was observed for a catalyst modified at 100 C. The selectivity for this catalyst was also much higher than the one modified at room temperature (curve 3 in Fig. 1 and Table 4). Discussion For the present catalysts our data indicate that: (1) Amino bases lower the intrinsic selectivity of Ni tartrate complexes. (2) Upon increasing the temperature, the selectivity of catalysts with- out poisons decreases. This decrease is essentially irreversible. 191 TABLE 4 The temperature dependence of selectivity for pyridine-poisoned Ni catalyst Reaction temperature ( C) Conversion (%) 55 44 62 79 94 120 46.0 32.3 59.2 76.8 86.2 90.1 25.3 2.9 27.5 3.2 26.3 2.5 26.6 2.3 30.6 1.8 24.8 2.2 \"Catalyst: Ni/SiO^; modification: 100 ml 2 wt.% tartaric acid (pH 5) at 100 C for 2 h; reaction conditions: H^ flow rate: 200 ml min~1, MAA saturator temperature: 11 C, PMAA = -34 Torr, wt. of catalyst = 0.4855 g. (3) The selectivity of catalysts poisoned with amino bases exhibits a remarkable temperature stability. It remains basically constant between 50 and 110 C. One possible reason for the temperature dependence of the selectivity could be that both selective and non-selective sites contribute significantly to the overall conversion; but selective sites and non-selective sites have dif- ferent values of the activation energy. The activation energies reported by different research groups are somewhat different. Yasumori [11] reported the same value for modified and unmodified catalysts, while Bostelaar found a small but significant difference (57 4 kJ moF1 for unmodified catalyst, 46 3 kJ moP1 for modified catalyst) [4]. With a higher activation energy for non-selective sites, one would expect the selectivity of a modified catalyst to decrease with increasing reaction temperature. A different rationalization of the temperature dependence of the selec- tivity is suggested by our recent results [13]. It was found that under the modification conditions used in this laboratory, the metal surface of the catalyst is virtually completely covered with nickel tartrate complexes, but the intrinsic selectivity is significantly lower than 100%. Upon changing the temperature, the contribution of non-modified non-selective sites on such a catalyst should remain negligible. Thus the change of the intrinsic selectivity of the selective sites dominates the temperature dependence of the overall selectivity. Thus our data points to the fact that the amino bases interact with the Ni tartrate complexes, which is in agreement with the fact the bond between Ni2\"1\" and pyridine is stronger than that between Ni and pyridine. The poisoned catalysts of the present work display behavior different than those without poison with respect to the temperature dependence of the enantioselectivity. Also, the effects of poisons at any given temperature for the present gas-phase hydrogenation differ qualitatively from those reported in the literature for static liquid-phase experiments. While in the 192 latter case the ammo bases enhanced selectivities, they lower the selectivity in the present gas-phase flow experiments. A rationalization of our data requires some assumptions on the nature of the selective sites. The structure of the nickel tartrate complex on the modified surface is not known. But Ni2((-R,-R)-C4H40(,)2- W^O was recently synthesized and analyzed by Bostelaar et al. [14]. The basic building block is a dimer shown in Fig. 2. Each dimer has 2 Ni2\"1\" cations, 2 tartrate ligands, 2 ligand water molecules and 3 crystal water molecules which are not shown in Fig. 2. HOD Pig. 2. Structure of a dimeric unit of Mi2((.R,.R)-C4H406)2'2H20 [14]. 12<?\"1 0(212'\") Different thermal analysis of the nickel tartrate salt [4] showed that this compound decomposes in two endothermic reaction steps. In the first, the hydrated salt loses its water between 65 and 120 C. At 86 C, the dehydration reaction can be described to be linearly dependent on time, until ~60% of the initial water content of the compound is lost. In the second step, the tartrate decomposes to Ni and/or ?0 and gaseous products, between 280 and 400 C [4]. If we assume that the nickel tartrate complex on the surface has a structure similar to that of the Ni tartrate salt, it appears possible that the decrease in selectivity at high temperature is due to the loss of crystal water. However, further direct evidence is needed to prove this. Ammo bases such as pyridine, which can be strongly adsorbed on the Ni surface, will poison the non-selective sites [15]. On the selective sites, pyridine may occupy either a ligand vacancy of the nickel tartrate complex or it could replace the crystal and ligand water molecules. Such sites are still 193 able to react with MAA, and they retain some catalytic activity. Because pyridine is more strongly adsorbed on the surface than water, the pyridine- 'poisoned' catalyst does not change much at elevated temperatures. In more general terms, we propose that Ni tartrate complexes occur on the surface with one or more vacant ligand sites on the central Ni2* ion. The sites with the highest coordinative unsaturation will have the highest cata- lytic activity, but also the lowest steric rigidity and therefore the lowest stereospecificity. Ligands such as H^O lower the coordinative unsaturation but increase the rigidity of the complex. Removal of these water molecules at higher temperature renders the site less rigid and thus lowers its intrinsic enantioselectivity. There is a well-documented precedent for this relation between coordi- native unsaturation and stereospecificity, viz. in the Ziegler-Natta catalyst [17, 18]. The a-modification of TiCIa has sites with one vacant ligand posi- tion on each surface Ti3\"1\" ion and this modification therefore displays a very high stereospecificity, the polymer of propene e.g. is highly isotactic. How- ever, the /3-TiCl3 modification displays two types of sites; one with one vacant ligand position as in a-TiCl3 (ft sites) and one with two vacancies per surface Ti3\"1\" ion (f3n sites): ^ /^M ^c1 Cl-Ti-Cl- Ti-Cl ^ \\^ \\n \\ A ^c1 ^Ti^Cl^Ti^a f Cl \"D ft Ai Polymerization of propene over this (S-TiCIa results in a polymer of low tacticity. Moreover, it has been claimed that this polymer can be separated in two fractions, one of high isotacticity similar to the product formed on a-Tida, and a second fraction which is virtually atactic. This example shows that the low rigidity of sites with two vacant ligand positions leads to ex- tremely low stereospecificity of the catalytic process. Upon assuming that this general rule is valid also for the stereoselective sites on the modified Ni, it follows that desorption of water ligands at higher temperature might be the main cause for the decrease in enantioselectivity of catalysts without poisons. Upon replacing the H^O ligand by pyridine, sites are created of different, viz. lower, intrinsic selectivity. As pyridine is much more strongly bound to the Ni2* ion in the complex than is HzO, it will not be released at higher temperature. Therefore, the complex maintains its con- stant intrinsic enantioselectivity up to temperatures where pyrolysis sets in. Another interesting consequence of the model concerns the apparent activation energy as derived from Arrhenius curves. If it is correct that for catalysts without poisons, water is released upon increasing the temperature, and that the resulting enhanced coordinative unsaturation of the sites leads to higher activity but lower selectivity, it would follow that the apparent activation energy measured from the slope of the Arrhenius line is higher than the true activation energy of the active sites, since the nature of the 194 sites has changed. For pyridine-poisoned catalysts, however, only the true activation energy would be measured since the actual structure of the active sites does not change with temperature. This conclusion is indeed consistent with the data: from the values in Table 4, an activation energy of 31 kJ moP1 is calculated, which is lower than 46 kJ mor1 for the catalyst without poison. The remarkable fact that the poisoned catalyst with lower activity displays a lower activation energy lends some credence to the model pre- sented in this paper.
