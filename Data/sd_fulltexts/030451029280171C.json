Sibeijn and J. C. Mol Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Amsterdam, Nieume Achtergracht 166, 1018 WV Amsterdam (Netherlands) Abstract In the ethenolysis of methyl oleate a 18 wt.% Re207/AI203 catalyst promoted with tetrabutyltin appeared to be more active per unit weight of catalyst than a promoted 3 wt.% Re207/SiO2-A1203 catalyst. The conversion over 18 wt.% Re20,/A120s increased with increasing ethene pressure, while over 3 wt.% Re207/SiOZ-A'201 it possessed an optimum value. This difference is due to the fact that the silica-alumina-supported catalyst deactivates in the presence of ethene (2-50 bar), while the alumina-supported catalyst remains stable. For both catalysts at high ethene pressures enhanced self-metathesis of ethene suppresses the self-metathesis of methyl aleate. The turnover number of the 18 wt. % Re207/A1203 catalyst increased with increasing molar ratio of methyl oleate to Re201 to a certain value and then remained almost constant. The turnover number of the 3 wt.% Re2O7/SiOZ-A1203 catalyst, however, decreased with increasing molar ratio, as the deactivation of this catalysb was enhanced by the increase in the amount of methyl oleate. The promoted,.4,wt.% Re207/S'O2-A1203 is more active per Re atom at methyl oleate/Re207 molar ra~os of up to 400, while at higher molar ratios the A1203-supported catalyst is more active per Re atom. The turnover number of Re20,/A'203 catalysts increased with increasing Re207 loading, whereas the turnover number of Re207/Si02-A1203 catalysts decreased with increasing Re207 loading. Introduction Co-metathesis of an internal alkene with ethene is an interesting reaction for the production of 1-alkenes: RCH=CHR' + CH2=CH, RCH=CHZ+R'CH=CH2 Bradshaw et al. [1], who were among the first to recognize its utility in this respect, named the reaction ethenolysis. Since then various processes have been developed that use ethenolysis to produce 1-alkenes. Examples are the production of propene from ethene and 2-butene (the reverse of the Phillips Triolefin Process) [2] and the Shell FEAST process, which employs the ethenolysis of cyclooctene and cyclooctadiene to synthesize cx,co-unsaturated alkenes for use in the production of specialty chemicals [3]. 0304-5102/92/$5.00 1992 - Elsevier Sequoia. All rights reserved 346 An even more interesting reaction is the ethenolysis of functionally substituted alkenes. This reaction permits the synthesis of 0)-unsaturated functionalized alkenes, which are intermediates in the production of,fine chemicals. In particular, the ethenolysis of fatty acid esters (methyl oleate, methyl erucate, etc.) is a promising reaction, because it yields products that are difficult to obtain via other routes. Thus the ethenolysis of methyl oleate will lead to methyl 9-decenoate and 1-decene [4] CH3(CH2),CH=CH(CH2),COOCH3 + CHZ=CH2 * CH3(CH2)ICH=CH2 + CHZ=CH(CHZ),COOCH3 Methyl 9-decenoate is an interesting chemical building block; it is, for instance, the key intermediate in the synthesis of 9-oxo-traps-decenoic acid (a honeybee pheromone), it can be converted into methyl 9-oxodecenoate (an important prostaglandin intermediate), and hydrogenolysis of it gives 9-decen-l-of (a rose essence in perfumery). In addition, it could also be the source of many polymers and copolymers. Moreover, a valuable byproduct, 1-decene, is obtained. Ethenolysis of such unsaturated esters with a long carbon chain between the carbon-carbon double bond and the ester group can also be used to produce detergent-range fatty acid esters (Clo=C14), which are in short supply on the world market [5]. Because of the many potential uses for its reaction products, we decided to investigate the ethenolysis of methyl oleate further. Bosma et al. [4] have already demonstrated for both WCls-Sn(CH3)4 and Re20,/ Al, 03-Sn(C,H5)4 as the catalyst system that using a high ethene pressure will force the ethenolysis equilibrium to the product side and also suppress the self-metathesis tendency of methyl oleate into 9-octadecene and dimethyl 9-octadecenedioate. In the present study we investigated the ethenolysis of methyl oleate over various supported Re,O, catalysts, viz., Re,O, supported on silicaalumina and on alumina, promoted with tetrabutyltin. The effect of the ethene pressure in the ethenolysis of methyl oleate was studied in more detail, as well as the effect of the reaction temperature, the Re,O, loading of the catalyst and the methyl oleate-to-Re207 molar ratio. Experimental Catalyst preparation The Re,O, catalysts were prepared by pore-volume impregnation of the support material as described earlier [6]. The supports, SiO2-A1203 (type HA; 24.3 wt.% A1203; BET surface area 380 m2 g-1; pore volume 0.91 cm3 g-1) and y-A1203 (type CK-300; BET surface area 208 m2 g-1; pore volume 0.51 cm' g-1), were obtained from AKZO Chemicals. 347 Chemicals Methyl oleate was prepared from its urea adduct (Unilever). The urea adduct (1 kg) was hydrolysed under nitrogen with 0.51 of a 10% hydrochloric acid solution, after which petroleum ether (boiling point range 40-60 C) was added to prevent further hydrolysis of the methyl oleate. The organic layer was separated from the water layer and consecutively washed with a saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate and with water. The organic layer was then dried on sodium sulphate, and any traces of free acids were removed by potassium carbonate. After vacuum distillation, the methyl oleate (purity > 97% by GC analysis) was stored under dry argon until used. Tetrabutyltin (Aldrich) was used as received. Hexane, the solvent, was distilled over sodium under argon before use. Ethene (UCAR, grade 2.7) was purified by means of purification beds of y-A1203, 3A molecular sieves and Cu/A1203, respectively. Ethenolysis The ethenolysis reactions were carried out in a stainless-steel batch autoclave with a capacity of about 9 cm3. The catalyst was first calcined by heating it to 823 K in an oxygen stream (60 cm3 min-1) at a rate of 20 K min-1. After 2 h at this temperature, the catalyst was cooled to the reaction temperature (usually 297 K). The measurements at 273 K were performed by placing the reactor in a water/ice mixture. Next the oxygen was replaced by argon. Subsequently a solution of tetrabutyltin in hexane was added, followed by the addition of methyl oleate and ethene. During the reaction the reaction mixture was stirred vigorously while the ethene pressure was kept constant. After the reaction, ethene was blown off, and the liquid phase was analysed. The methyl oleate/Re207/Sn(n-C,H,), molar ratio was 240/1/1.1 in the experiments with the silica-aluminasupported catalysts, while in the case of alumina-supported catalysts this molar ratio was 40/1/0.2, unless otherwise noted. In a typical experiment 100 mg of catalyst (6.2 pmol of Re207 for 3 wt.% Re207/SiOz-A1203, 37.2 pmol of Re207 for 18 wt.% Re207/A1203) was used, to which 1 ml of hexane, containing 2.46 pl (7 pmol) of tetrabutyltin, and 0.5 ml (1.45 mmol) of methyl oleate were added. After this the ethene was introduced. The reaction products were analysed -by GC analysis (Carlo Erba MEGA HRC 6000) of the liquid phase using a capillary column (J&W Scientific, type DBl; 30 m x 0.53 mm i.d.) and a flame ionization detector. The peak areas of the gas chromatograms, corrected for the molecular response according to Ackman's method [7, 8], were used for the calculation of the following conversions: co-metathesis = 1-decease/(1-decease + 2 x 9-octadecene + methyl oleate) x 100% 348 self-metathesis = 2 x 9-octadecene/(1-decene + 2 x 9-octadecene + methyl oleate) x 100% Results Ethenolysis of methyl oleate at an ethene pressure of 30 bar It has been shown that different supports lead to quite different Re20,-based catalysts, for example, compared with A1203, Si02-A1203 leads to much better catalysts. For instance, 18 wt.% Re207/AI,03 and 3 wt.% Re207/Si02-A1203, promoted with a tetraalkyltin compound, exhibit comparable per-unit-weight activities in the self-metathesis of methyl oleate [9]. We compared these two catalysts with respect to their activity per unit 'weight in the ethenolysis of methyl oleate. Figure 1 shows the conversion at an ethene pressure of 30 bar as a function of the reaction time for both catalysts. It appeared that 18 wt.% Re207/AI,03 was more active than 3 wt.% Re207/SiO2-A1203. In a separate experiment a conversion of 97% was obtained after 60 h of reaction time when a methyl oleate/Re207 molar ratio of 20/1 (instead of 240/1) was used for the 3 wt.% Re207/Si02-A1203 catalyst. As a conversion of 97% could not be reached by applying higher methyl oleate/Re20,, molar ratios, this indicates that deactivation of the silica -alumina-supported catalyst occurred. Figure 1 shows that the co-metathesis conversion of the silica-aluminasupported catalyst remained constant (ca. 70%) after 2 h of reaction time. 100 80 40 20 0 .B wt% Re,O, A1,0, wt% Re,O,/SiO,.A1,0, 0 0 1 2 3 4 reaction time / h Fig. 1.

Molar ratio of methyl oleate/Re20.,/ Sn(n-CQH9)4 for 3 wt.% Re20.,/SiO2~A1203 = 240/1/1.1; for 18 wt.% Re207/A120;ss it was 40/1/ 0.2. 349 Even after 18 h of reaction time the conversion was still ca. 70%. In the following we will use a standard conversion, uiz., after 30 min of reaction time. Deactivation of the catalyst can have several causes [5]. An intrinsic deactivation mechanism might occur, but the ester group of methyl oleate could also be the cause of deactivation. To determine which substrate deactivated the catalysts we carried out several experiments in which the catalyst was first brought into contact with either ethene or methyl oleate for 0.5 h in order to allow self-metathesis of the substrate to proceed. Afterward the other substrate was introduced and the mixture was allowed to react for a further 0.5 h. The results of these experiments are shown in Table 1. From this table it can be concluded that the presence of methyl oleate was the main cause of the deactivation of the catalysts. Ethene had no deactivating effect on 18 wt.% Re2O,/A1203, while it caused only a slight deactivation of 3 wt.% Re207/Si02-A1203. Another noteworthy fact is that when the catalysts were first brought into contact with methyl oleate for 0.5 h, the molar ratios of 1-decene to methyl 9-decenoate and of 9-octadecene to dimethyl 9-decenedioate were not equal to one; for the silica- alumina-supported catalyst these ratios were 0.6 and 3.6, respectively, while for the alumina-supported catalyst these ratios were 0.8 and 2.2, respectively. From these ratios it could be concluded that on both catalysts dimethyl 9-octadecenedioate rather than 9-octadecene was preferentially converted. The ratios indicate that there was a large amount of 9-octadecene compared with dimethyl 9-octadecenedioate and a relatively large amount of methyl 9-decenoate compared with 1-decene. These differences were less pronounced for the alumina-supported catalyst than for the silica-aluminasupported catalyst. Effect of the ethene pressure and the reaction temperature All of the above-mentioned experiments were performed at an ethene pressure of 30 bar. Because a high ethene pressure drives the ethenolysis reaction to the product side, we studied the effect of the ethene pressure on the catalytic activity. Figure 2 shows that for the 18 wt.% Re20,,/A1203 catalyst the conversion increased with increasing ethene pressure over the whole pressure range studied. Table 2 shows that the conversion was even higher when a higher reaction temperature was applied. From Fig. 2 it is also clear that for the 3 wt.% Re20,/SiO2-A1203 catalyst the optimal ethene pressure at three different temperatures was ca. 30 bar. The conversion was higher at higher reaction temperatures, as was also observed for the alumina-supported catalyst. The activity of the catalyst system decreased very rapidly with decreasing reaction temperature. At 263 K the co-metathesis conversion was only 9% at an ethene pressure of 30 bar. At this temperature all of the substrates and products were still in the liquid phase.

During the co-metathesis of ethene and methyl oleate, self-metathesis of both methyl oleate and ethene also occurs. Only the self-metathesis of methyl oleate can, of course, be observed. Figure 2 shows the self-metathesis of methyl oleate during ethenolysis over 3 wt.% Rez07/SiO2~A1203 at various reaction temperatures, and over 18 wt.% Re207/A1203 at 297 K as a function of the ethene pressure. This confirms that self-metathesis of methyl oleate can be suppressed by using high ethene pressures, but also shows that at higher reaction temperatures the self-metathesis conversion of methyl oleate was higher ( Fig. 2 and Table 2). 352 Effect of the methyl oleate/Re20, molar ratio Figure 3 shows that an increase in the molar ratio of methyl oleate to Re20, resulted in a decrease in the co-metathesis conversion for 3 wt.% Re207/S'02-Al.03. The turnover number (i.e., the number of effective co-metathesis reactions of methyl oleate per mol Re207 in the first half hour of reaction time) first increased and then decreased with increasing molar ratio. The relatively low turnover number at low molar ratios is expected because of the low methyl oleate concentration. Figure 4 shows that for the 18 wt.% Re207/Al203 catalyst the conversion also decreased with increasing ratio of methyl oleate to Re20,.

Molar ratio of methyl oleate/Re207/Sn(n-C,H,), = 120J1/0.2. React. temp. 297 K. turnover number, however, first increased and remained essentially constant with increasing molar ratio. The maximum turnover number of the silica -alumina-supported catalyst is roughly twice as high as that of the alumina-supported catalyst. From Figs. 3 and 4 it is clear that at low 354 methyl oleate/Re20, molar ratios the SiO2-AI203-supported catalyst is more active per Re atom, while at molar ratios above ca. 400/1 the A1203-supported catalyst is more active per Re atom. Effect of the rhenium loading It could be expected that the rhenium loading of the catalysts would affect their turnover numbers during ethenolysis, as this has also been observed in the self-metathesis of methyl oleate [6]. Therefore we compared the turnover numbers after 0.5 h of reaction time for various Re20,/Si02-A1203 catalysts at 10, 30 and 50 bar (Fig. 5). At all of these pressures the turnover number decreased with increasing RezO, loading. We also investigated the effect of the rhenium loading for alumina-supported catalysts at an ethene pressure of 30 bar. In this case we used a methyl oleate/Re20, molar ratio of 120/1. Figure 6 shows that the turnover number of these catalysts increased with increasing Re20, loading. Discussion In order to be able to compare the catalysts we used the same weights of catalyst and reactants. It is clear that the promoted 18 wt.% Re207/ A1203 catalyst is more active than the promoted 3 wt.% Re207/SiO2.AI203 catalyst. This is remarkable, because both catalysts exhibit comparable activities in the metathesis of methyl oleate [9]. This can be explained on the basis of results published earlier [10]. During impregnation of the support and subsequent calcination, ion exchange, complex formation and decomposition reactions take place. Stoichiometrically, a surface OH group is substituted by a Re04 group. Important is that substitution of basic OH groups results in catalysts of low activity, whereas substitution of acidic OH groups leads to highly active catalysts. Therefore, silica-alumina, containing acidic OH groups, has a high catalytic activity [6]. On alumina, basic OH groups are present, which are preferentially replaced by Re04. At higher Re207 loadings, besides the basic OH groups, acidic OH groups also react with the Re04 ions, which results in an increase in activity per Re atom of the aluminasupported catalysts [10]. However, even at high loadings the electron deficiency of the Re centre on the alumina-supported catalyst will be less than that on the silica- alumina-supported catalyst, because the Bronsted acidity of silica-alumina is much higher than that of alumina [11]. This was also apparent from results of comparable experiments in the metathesis of 1-octene [12]. The selectivity of a promoted 3 wt.% Re207/ Si02-AI,O3 catalyst toward the self-metathesis products of 1-octene was only 85% after 0.5 h of reaction time, owing to isomerisation reactions on the acidic OH groups, while the selectivity of a promoted alumina-supported catalyst was greater than 95%. The addition of a saturated ester (viz., methyl acetate) resulted in an increase in selectivity to almost 100% 355 for the silica -alumina-supported catalyst, although the activity decreased [12]. The increase in selectivity can be ascribed to a decreased acidity due to the interaction of the ester groups with the acidic OH groups [13], while the decrease in activity can be ascribed to the complexation of the ester group to the Re centre. Thus polar groups, such as ester groups, will interact with both electron-deficient Re centres and acidic OH groups on the catalyst. Almost no acidic OH groups are present on the surface of the 18 wt.% Re20,/A1203 catalyst, owing to a monolayer coverage of the Re04 groups {10]. Moreover, as discussed before, the Re centres on this catalyst are less electron deficient than those on the silica- alumina-supported catalyst. Concluding, we can expect that the ester group will have a stronger interaction with the silica -alumina-supported catalyst than with the alumina-supported one. In the (co)metathesis of methyl oleate two types of reaction can take place at the Re centre. The first type of reaction is the complexation of the carbon-carbon double bond, which is necessary for the propagation of the metathesis reaction. The other type of reaction is the complexation of the ester group to the Re centre, which is the main cause of the deactivation of the catalyst. In our experimental setup the methyl oleate was introduced prior to the ethene. Consequently, the methyl oleate could interact with the catalysts before the ethene. It might be that the complexation of the ester group to the Re centre is reversible and can be undone by ethene. The removal of the ester group by ethene will be easier on the alumina-supported catalyst, because this catalyst has a weaker interaction with the ester group than the silica- alumina-supported catalyst. This can explain why in the ethenolysis the 18 wt.% Re2O,/A1203 catalyst is more active than the 3 wt.% Re20,/Si02-A1,03 catalyst. This is also shown in the experiments in which the methyl oleate was allowed to undergo self-metathesis during 0.5 h before the ethene was introduced (Table 1). For both catalysts, the 1-decene to methyl 9-decenoate molar ratios were less than unity and the 9-octadecene to dimethyl 9-octadecenedioate ratios were greater than unity. During the self-metathesis of methyl oleate, 9-octadecene and dimethyl 9-octadecenedioate are produced in equal amounts. Apparently after the introduction of ethene there is a preference for the reaction with the diester rather than the alkene. This can be explained by assuming that the product molecules that are adsorbed on the catalyst will first react. On both catalysts the diester, and to a lesser extent methyl oleate, are adsorbed, but we can conclude that this complexation is stronger on silica-alumina than on alumina, because the molar ratios for the 3 wt.% RezO,/ Si02-A1203 catalyst differ more from unity than those of the 18 wt.% Re20,/A1203 catalyst. The latter observation is corroborated by results in batch reactors. In the self-metathesis of methyl oleate it appeared that the adsorption of the dimethyl 9-octadecenedioate was higher for the 356 silica- alumina-supported catalyst than for the alumina-supported catalyst [12]. Effect of reaction temperature For both catalysts the activity for ethenolysis and self-metathesis of methyl oleate increased with increasing reaction temperature. Although one would expect that the co-metathesis conversion would decrease because less ethene is dissolved in the liquid reaction mixtures at higher reaction temperatures, the increase in reaction rate with increasing reaction temperature is apparently more important for the overall activity. Effect of ethene pressure One could expect that the ethenolysis conversion would increase with increasing ethene pressure, because more ethene will dissolve in the reaction mixture. From Fig. 2 we see that for the 18 wt.% Re20,,/A1203 catalyst this is indeed the case. However, for the 3 wt.% Re20,/SiO,.AI,O, catalyst there is an optimal conversion at an ethene pressure of 30 bar (Fig. 2). This can be explained as follows. From Table 1 it can be concluded that the presence of ethene deactivates the 3 wt.% Re207/ Si02-AI,O, catalyst slightly. Using TPO measurements it was checked whether this deactivation could be caused by ethene polymerization; no polymers were detected [14]. At high ethene pressures there will be enhanced self-metathesis of ethene, which is not observable, but which is able to deactivate the silica- alumina-supported catalyst, resulting in a lower conversion. Apparently the activity of the alumina-supported catalyst is not affected by the increased self-metathesis of ethene. An indication of the enhanced self-metathesis of ethene at high ethene pressures is the suppression of the self-metathesis of methyl oleate at high ethene pressures, which is observed for both catalysts (Fig. 2). Effect of methyl oleate/Re20, molar ratio From Figs. 3 and 4 we can conclude that the silica -alumina-supported catalyst has a higher maximum turnover number than the alumina-supported one, which is in accordance with results from the self-metathesis of methyl oleate [6]. The turnover number of the silicaalumina-supported catalyst shows a maximum at a molar ratio of methyl oleate/Re207 = 240/1, as is the case for the alumina-supported catalyst. The turnover number of the alumina-supported catalyst remains essentially constant with increasing molar ratio after reaching the maximum turnover number. When the methyl oleate to Re20, ratio is increased, the amount of liquid in the reactor is also increased. The concentration of ethene in the reaction mixture will remain the same. Thus the molar ratio of ethene to methyl oleate is not affected, but the increase in the amount of methyl oleate means that the deactivation of the catalysts by complexation of the 357 ester group to the Re centre can increase. For the silica -alumina-supported catalyst we indeed saw a sharp decrease in turnover number at higher methyl oleate to Re,07 ratios. There is essentially no decrease in turnover number above a molar ratio of 240/1 for the alumina-supported catalyst, because the interaction with the ester group is weaker. Effect of the Re20, loading For both supports we investigated the effect of the Re,07 loading (Figs. 5 and 6). For the silica -alumina-supported catalyst, we observed a decrease in turnover number with increasing Re207 loading, which was also observed in the self-metathesis of methyl oleate over the same catalyst [6]. This has been explained by the limited amount of appropriate OH groups at the surface of the silica-alumina support [6]. The alumina-supported Re207 catalyst showed different behaviour. The turnover number increased with increasing Re,07 loading, even at loadings higher than 12 wt.% Re207, which is also the case in the metathesis of propene [15]. In the self-metathesis of methyl oleate, however, an optimal turnover number is found at around 12 wt.% Re207 [16]. Ellison et al. [16] ascribe the decrease in the turnover number at Re207 loadings higher than 12 wt.% to the adsorption of the diester on the surface. They hypothesize that the desorption of the diester becomes the rate-determining step at higher rhenium loadings. This was supported by the fact that the acidity of A1203-supported catalysts increases with increasing Re207 loading [11]. Thus at higher Re207 loadings the ester group has a stronger interaction with the catalyst, which slows down the desorption rate of the diester and methyl oleate. In the ethenolysis reaction, however, the deactivating effect of the ester group is reduced by the presence of ethene, as has been discussed before, so that no decrease in activity is observed at higher Re207 loadings. Conclusions In the ethenolysis of methyl oleate the 18 wt.% Re207/A1203 catalyst promoted with tetrabutyltin shows a higher activity per unit weight of catalyst than the promoted 3 wt.% Re207/S102'A1203 catalyst. This is attributed to the fact that the interaction of the ester group is stronger with the silica- alumina-supported catalyst, because the main deactivation is caused by complexation of the ester group to the Re centre. The 18 wt.% Re207/Al20, catalyst shows increasing co-metathesis conversion with increasing ethene pressure, whereas the 3 wt.% Re, 07/ S'02-Al203 catalyst shows an optimal co-metathesis conversion at an ethene pressure of 30 bar, independent of the reaction temperature. This difference is ascribed to the fact that the silica- alumina-supported catalyst deactivates in the presence of ethene, while the alumina-supported 358 catalyst remains stable. Both catalysts show increasing conversion when the reaction temperature is increased. When the molar ratio of methyl oleate to Re207 is increased, both catalysts show a decrease in the co-metathesis conversion. The turnover number of 3 wt.% Re207/SiO2-A1203 decreases sharply with increasing molar ratio, while the turnover number of 18 wt.% Re207/A1203 is hardly affected. For 3 wt.% Re207/SiO2-AI,O3 the maximum turnover number is obtained at a molar ratio of methyl oleate to Re207 of 240/1. The 3 wt.% Re207/SiO2-Alz03 is more active per Re atom at molar ratios of methyl oleate to Re207 of up to 400/1, while at higher molar ratios the 18 wt.% Re207/A12O, catalyst is more active per Re atom. Re207/Si02-AI203 shows decreasing activity with increasing Re207 loading, whereas Re207/A1203 shows increasing activity with increasing Re207 loading.
