The influences of the reaction conditions on the cyclodehydration kinetics, as well as those of the preparation conditions of these bimetals in connection with their physicochemical properties, were studied. It appears that the cyclodehydration sites involve copper, noble metal and halogen, this last element coming from the precursor salt used during the modification of Raney copper. Lack of one of these two last elements: noble metal without halogen or halogen without noble metal, does not allow the complete removal of the hydroxylated sites responsible for the degradation reactions.

Introduction Studies on the competitive cleavages of C-C and C-O bonds in polyols such as glucitol (sorbitol) (GCL) or erythritol (EL) in the aqueous phase on metals had revealed the special properties of copper, particularly those of Raney copper [ 11. In the aqueous medium, between 473 and 533 K, this metal is not hydrogenolyzing but is able to dehydrogenate CO bonds into carbonyls that are irreversibly adsorbed.

Montassier et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 119-128 cleavage of C-O bonds (dehydroxylation) and C-C bonds (retro-Claisen and retroMichael). Raney copper modification with a more noble metal (M=Ru, Pt) than copper by an oxido-reduction technique in the aqueous phase [ 2,4] leads to bimetals (Cu-M) with various metallic modifier contents. If this content is greater than about 15%, these catalysts lose their degradative properties in favor of a selective cyclodehydration reaction that allows for example the conversion of glucitol mainly into isosorbide: CHz0H &--0H HO sa O~HHO4H ; H &--OH `'H `H s CH-OH O . '' H 7 H 6 CHz-OH or of erythritol into 1,4-anhydroerythritol: CHz-OH 2 CH-OH _ 10 & --OH 2 CH--0H OH OH CHZ OH The investigation of these catalysts by EDS (X energy dispersive spectrometry during electronic microscopy observation) [3,4] showed that the surface of copper particles is made up of rims (low coordinated copper atoms) and flat faces. During the modification by oxido-reduction, ruthenium atoms are selectively deposited onto the rims excluding flat faces. In the case of platinum and gold these deposits occur mainly on the rims, but also affect the flat faces. On the other hand, the precursors of these metals being chlorides salts, chloride appears on the bimetals located at the same sites as the noble metal on the copper surface. The aim of this work is to generalize, in the case of polyol conversions, the previous observations for ruthenium and platinum used as modifiers to those of gold and palladium, and to determine several influences on activity and selectivity towards polyol cyclodehydration: (1) experimental conditions during the reaction and during the modification of the basic Raney copper, (2) nature of the precursors of the modifier metal used. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalysts The preparation of Cu-M bimetals from Raney copper by oxido-reduction has been described in detail elsewhere [ 2,4] . Raney copper has a surface area of 18 m2. g -' or 4.36 X 10-4 mol of surface copper atoms. Preparation of a bimetal is carried out on 4 g of C. Montassier et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 119-128 121 Raney copper in 100 cm' of water in which the desired amount of the modifier ions is added. The slurry is stirred by nitrogen bubbling during 10 h unless otherwise stated. Nomenclature used for these catalysts is: Cu-M-x where M refers to the metallic modifier and x to the atomic percentage of this metal relative to surface copper initially on the surface of the Raney metal. 2.2. Reactions The detailed procedures were described previously [1,2]. Typically, 4 g of catalyst suspended into 140 cm' of water were introduced into an 300 cm3 autoclave (Autoclave Engineers) flushed with nitrogen, then with hydrogen. After raising the temperature and stabilization at 493 K (1 h), 20 cm' of a concentrated polyol solution (GCL or EL, final concentration 0.11 M) were introduced simultaneously with hydrogen whose partial pressure was set at 4 MPa. The reaction was characterized by the initial rate of polyol disappearance (vi) and by the selectivity Sc1c+o defined as the ratio of the initial rate of the cyclodehydration reaction C to vi(C+D). 3. Results 3.1. Effect of the nature of the metallic modifier (chloride precursors) Fig. 1 shows that the variation of the initial rate of glucitol conversion versus the gold surface content offers the same shape as that previously described for Cu-Ru and Cu-Pt. Moreover, the selectivity follows the same course: for 0 < x < 20%, degradation reactions (C-C and C-0 cleavages) are inhibited whereas for x > 20%, glucitol is totally converted by cyclodehydration as it is the case for the two other bimetals. The behavior of the Cu-Pd bimetals was not studied in detail, but Table 1 shows that if vi 3 2 i i 0 J. i 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 x(Cu-M-x) Fig. 1.

Thus the properties of these catalysts seem to be largely independent of the nature of the noble metal interacting with copper. Nevertheless, a small displacement of the activity minimum should be noted in function of the nature of the metallic modifier: it is located at approximately 10% for Cu-Ru, 15% for Cu-Pt and 20% for Cu-Au. These values will be found again afterward for Cu-Pt and Cu-Au ( Figs. 2 and 3 ) . 3.2. Effects of the reaction conditions 3.2.1. Hydrogen pressure effects Hydrogen is consumed during the degradation reactions. At the opposite it is not involved in the balance of the cyclodehydration reactions but may play a role on the oxidation degree of the species lying at the catalyst surface. The shapes of the curves showing the evolution of the glucitol conversion versus the platinum content of the Cu-Pt catalysts for 1 and 4 MPa of hydrogen pressure (Fig. 2) indicate that the activity minimum does not move significantly according to this pressure. On the other hand hydrogen has a promotor effect on the rate of cyclodehydration. This last C. Montassier et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 119-128 123 effect was confirmed in the case of Cu-Au-100 as shown in Table 2, whereas gold is unable to activate the dihydrogen as opposed to platinum. 3.2.2. Effect of the nature of the polyol Variations of the initial rates on Cu-Au for glucitol conversion at 493 K and for erythritol conversion at 513 K (Fig. 3) show that the location of the activity minimum (and thus the change in selectivity) does not move according to the nature of the polyol and to the temperature. 3.2.3. Temperature effect An increase of the reaction temperature between 473 and 493 K enhances the rate of the cyclodehydration of glucitol on Cu-Au-100. The apparent activation energy is approximately 165 kJ mol', a value largely greater than that of degradation reactions on Raney copper in the case of glycerol: 90 kJ mol' [ 1 ] .

Effect of the nature of the precursor salt of the metallic modifier 3.3.1. Effect of the anions The weight analysis of the catalysts obtained with chlorinated precursors show that all contain chloride. The EDS maps established clearly that this chloride is deposited on the same sites of the copper as the metallic modifier. Thus it was important to specify the role, in reaction, of the anions present in the salt of the noble metal used. Two catalysts Cu-Pt-100 and Cu-Pd-100 were prepared using the nitrates of platinum (II ) and palladium (Il) . Table 3 shows that they are much less selective for the cyclodehydration than the chlorinated catalysts: the degradation reactions become the main overall reaction path. Thus the attainment of a high cyclodehydration selectivity is not only the result of the interactions between the copper and the metallic modifier, but also of a strong effect of the chloride. The nature of the halide present in the metal precursor has an enhancing effect on the initial rate of the glucitol conversion in the order I > Br > Cl as shown in Table 3. The three catalysts Cu-Pt-100 were prepared from HZPtCIb, HZPtBrb and PtI4+HI, so that the initial halide content was constant. No degradation product appears on any of these catalysts. Moreover it is difficult to correlate these reaction rates with the physico-chemical properties of the halide as their amounts in the initial after reaction catalysts have not been measured. Thus only the information of whether the selectivity is independent of the halide nature will be taken into account. 3.3.2. Effect of the cations In order to separate the effect of the chloride and of the metallic modifier, some experiments were done with Raney copper modified by hydrochloric acid, cupric nitrate and cupric chloride. The results for the glucitol conversion are given in Table 3 and can be compared with unmodified copper and Cu-Pt-100. Raney copper treated by hydrochloric acid (chloride amount equal to that used for the Table 3 Effect of anions and cations of the precursor modifier on glucitol conversion a: initial rates of conversion and selectivities Catalyst Precursor v; x 10' Scic+o (mol . min-' - g-' ) Cu-Pd-100 PdC12 0.41 > 0.95 Cu-Pd-100 Pd(NO,)2 0.34 0.28 Cu-Pt-100 H2PtC16 2.00 >0.95 Cu-Pt-100 Pt(N03)2 0.50 0.26 Cu-Pt-100 H2PtBrb 2.20 > 0.95 Cu-Pt-100 HZPtlh 2.60 > 0.95 Cu + Ci HCl 0.34 0.39 Cu-Cu-100 Cu(N03)2 0.18 0 Cu-Cu-100 CUC12 0.22 0.86 Cu-Cu-300 CUC12 2.20 0.91 'CGL 0.1 1 M; 4 g Cu-M-x; 493 K; 4 MPs H2.

This amount is very similar to that of Cu-Pt-100 catalyst: 0.47. Furthermore EDS observations have shown that this chloride is deposited on to the rims of copper as in the case of Cu-Ru-33. This chlorinated Raney copper was less active than the original Raney copper and Cu-Pt-100 catalysts. It was active for the cyclodehydratation but C-C and C-O cleavages still remained: SC,C+p=0.39. In a previous paper [ 4 ] we described the deposit of a copper complex when Raney copper is put in the presence of a cupric salt. The solids thus obtained were tested for the glucitol conversion. It can be seen that the nitrate precursor gave an inactive catalyst for the cyclodehydration whereas the chloride precursor gave a catalyst which was more active and selective for cyclodehydration, as its chloride content is greater, that is to say, as the amount of copper chloride precursor is greater. However, degradation reactions are still observed even with the Cu-Cu-300 catalyst. The same kind of copper complex deposition was observed during the preparation of bimetals from chlorinated salts of noble metals [4]. In these cases, the copper(II) released into solution comes from the oxidation of the surface copper together with the very quick reduction of the noble metal, but the deposition of copper complex was slower. Two experiments done with Cu-Pt-50, one submitted to the redeposition of the copper complex (prolonged oxido-reduction), the other without any (or very little) redeposition (short contact time). Their activities for glucitol conversion are very similar but, overall, they have the same high selectivities to cyclodehydration (Table 4). This set of experiments emphasizes the prime importance of chloride (halide) ions for the cyclodehydration, but shows also that the presence of a noble metal is necessary to cancel any degradation reaction. 3.4. Halogen lost during the reaction Chloride ions (bromide or iodide according to the precursor used) were detected in the reaction mixture by the HPLC analysis. Fig. 4 gives the time history of a glucitol conversion on Cu-Pt-100. Obviously, chloride ions appear before the onset of the reaction, that is to say during the temperature increase of the autoclave where the catalyst is only in contact with water. The chloride contents of new catalysts (prolonged oxido-reduction) and of the used one recovered after reaction are compared in Table 5. The loss of chloride is obvious, but it may be seen that the Cu-Pt catalyst selective for the cyclodehydration (Pt/Cu > 20%) , having the composition of the used catalysts all have an atomic ratio CI/Pt =0.2.

It is likely that the chloride appearing in solution during the temperature rise of the catalyst in the aqueous slurry came from redissolution of the copper complex deposited during the oxido-reduction, but this question was not studied in details. The pH of a 0.11 M glucitol solution is 6.3 whereas it is about 5.0 after reduction. This very small change cannot be correlated with the chloride appearing in solution. 4. Discussion Whatever the nature of the metallic modifier (Ru, Pt, Au, Pd), if the precursor is a chloride salt, the dependence of activity and selectivity according to the surface modifier content is the same. Especially the activity minimum is located between 10 to 20% of atomic surface content and the change of selectivity occurs at this minimum. This location is not appreciably modified by either the nature of the polyol, the reaction temperature, or the C. Montassier et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 119-128 127 hydrogen pressure. Thus hydrogen does not modify the cyclodehydration sites that are only the result of the reactions that occurred during the Raney copper modification. The EDS results [3,4] show good correlation with these observations: the ruthenium deposits on to the rims made of copper (1) are very selective, whereas no ruthenium appears on the flat faces made of metallic copper. The origin of this selectivity was attributed to the standard oxido-reduction potential values of the couples Ru(III)/Ru(0.38 V), Cu(ll)/ Cu (I) (0.15V),andCu(I1)/Cu(0.34V).FortheCu-Ru-xcatalysts,theactivityminimum for the glucitol conversion is located at Ru/Cu = 0.1. On the other hand in the cases of CuPt-x and Cu-Au-x, the deposit selectivities are lower because the metallic copper sites can be oxidized by the platinum and gold salts (Pt(IV) /Pt=0.74 V, Au(III) /Au=1.0 V). As a consequence, the activity minima during the glucitol conversion are displaced to higher metallic modifier contents: Pt/Cu, =0.15 and Au/Cus=0.20. The most selective catalysts for cyclodehydroxylation are those having a M/Cu ratio greater than 0.2 and containing a halide (Cl, Br, 1) . The EDS analysis showed that chloride is deposited on the same sites of copper as the metallic modifier. Thus, these particular sites would have the composition CuxM,X, (M noble metal, X halogenide) and in the case of M = Pt and X = Cl, it would be: CuxPtClI,.Z. The copper (I) species of Raney copper are assumed to be copper(1) hydroxyde responsible for the C-C and C-0 cleavages. The modification of Raney copper by an unhalogenated noble metal salt does not allow the complete suppression of these species. However, some cyclodehydration sites are created showing that the Cu-Pt and Cu-Au interactions are effective for this reaction probably because of an electronic shift from copper to M as previously suggested [ 2 ] Cu' +-M')- water or alcohol adsorptions are thus possible: H H R H 08+ os+ &-Ms- CuS+-MS- ~ L-M& (1) If the C-O bond is weakened enough, the intramolecular nucleophilic substitution can operate. Chloride deposition on Raney copper without any noble metal also leads to the appearance of cyclodehydration sites. A partial transformation of the copper(I) sites and perhaps of metallic copper into cuprous chloride would explain this result if it is assumed that the electrophilicity of copper(I) chloride can lead to the same type of adsorption as (1). In the case of the modification of Raney copper by hydrochloric acid, the reaction: CuOH + H + + Cl - ;i~ CuCl + HZ O explains the appearance of such sites. In the case of copper(II) chloride used as the precursor, the formation of a large number of cyclodehydration sites could be explained by a media mutation reaction: CU' + CUCIZ ;c~ 2CuC1. 128 C. Monta.ssier et al. /Journal of Molecular CatalYsi.s 9/ (/994) /l9-l28 However, if no noble metal has been added some hydroxylated copper(I) sites are still present leading to polyol degradations. Although hydrogen has no important effect on the cyclodehydration sites, it has an enhancing effect on the rate of this reaction whereas it does not operate either in the stoichiometry or in the mechanism. The bimetals (Cu-Ru and Cu-Au) are active for hydrogenation of carbonyls [ 2 ] . The hydrogen effect would be explained if we assume that the surface of these catalysts is competitively covered by adsorbed polyol molecules (leading to cyclodehydration products) and by dehydrogenated polyols (adsorbed carbonyls). An increase of the hydrogen pressure would move the adsorption equilibriums at the expense of the carbonyls. 5. Conclusion Upon modification of Raney copper by oxido-reduction using a halogenated salt of a noble metal, the surface cuprous hydroxides are first removed, thus deactivating the catalysts for the degradation reactions of polyols (C-C and C-O cleavages). The simultaneous presence of halogenide and noble metal is necessary to obtain a complete removal of these sites. In parallel, the modification creates new catalytic sites absent on the pure metal, composed of halogenated copper, or copper-noble metal association or, best of all of copper-halide-noble metal association. The main property of these new sites is a strong electrophilicity towards oxygen that enables the cyclodehydration of polyols to occur. References [ 1 ] C. Montassier, D. Giraud, J. Barbier and J.P.

( + 33)49453499. Bimetals prepared by addition of a noble metal (Ru, Pt, Au, Pd) on Raney copper catalyze very selectively the cyclodehydration reaction of polyols into furanic derivatives (e.g. sorbitol into isosorbide) whereas the pure metals catalyze the cleavages of CC and CO bonds (Cu, Ru) or are inactive (Pt, Au, Pd). The influences of the reaction conditions on the cyclodehydration kinetics, as well as those of the preparation conditions of these bimetals in connection with their physicochemical properties, were studied. It appears that the cyclodehydration sites involve copper, noble metal and halogen, this last element coming from the precursor salt used during the modification of Raney copper. Lack of one of these two last elements: noble metal without halogen or halogen without noble metal, does not allow the complete removal of the hydroxylated sites responsible for the degradation reactions.
