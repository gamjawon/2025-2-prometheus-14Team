(W. Dai) * Corresponding author. (T. Yan). The conversion of acetone derived from biomass to isobutene has attracted extensive attentions. In comparison with Brønsted acidic catalyst, Lewis acidic catalyst could exhibit a better catalytic performance with a higher isobutene selectivity. However, the catalyst stability remains a key problem for the long-running acetone conversion and the reasons for catalyst deactivation are poorly understood up to now. Herein, the deactivation mechanism of Lewis acidic Y/Beta catalyst during the acetone to isobutene conversion was investigated by various characterization techniques, including acetone-temperature-programmed surface reaction, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, in situ ultraviolet-visible, and13C cross polarization magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. A successive aldol condensation and cyclization were observed as the main side-reactions during the acetone conversion at Lewis acidic Y sites. In comparison with the low reaction temperature, a rapid formation and accumulation of the larger cyclic unsaturated aldehydes/ketones and aromatics could be observed, and which could strongly adsorb on the Lewis acidic sites, and thus cause the catalyst deactivation eventually. After a simple calcination, the coke deposits could be easily removed and the catalytic activity could be well restored. Graphical Abstract The deactivation mechanism of acetone to isobutene conversion over Y/Beta catalyst was investigated by several spectroscopic approaches. A rapid formation and accumulation of larger cyclic unsaturated aldehydes/ketones and aromatics is responsible for the catalyst deactivation.

Introduction As a crucial petrochemical building block, isobutene is mainly utilized to produce high-octane additives for gasoline, methacrolein, and acrylics [1–3]. Currently, isobutene is mostly obtained from steam cracking of crude naphtha [4,5]. With concerns about the goals of carbon peak and carbon neutrality, an alternative way to produce isobutene is extremely advantageous. Acetone is a pivotal biomass platform molecule produced by the fermentation of various starchy feedstocks [6]. Therefore, the conversion of acetone to isobutene has attracted widespread attention in recent years [1,7–11]. In general, the reaction pathway from acetone to isobutene is accepted and several pivotal reaction steps is now acknowledged (Scheme 1 ), including (1) acetone to diacetone alcohol via aldol condensation, (2) diacetone alcohol to mesityl oxide via dehydration reaction, (3) mesityl oxide to isobutene and acetic acid via cracking reaction, and (4) acetic acid to acetone and CO2 via ketonization reaction. It is obvious that this is a complicated reaction process and various side reactions could occur [12−15]. On the basis of aforementioned reaction route, the acetone to isobutene conversion initially occurred on Brønsted acid sites [16–20]. However, it is extremely likely that the isobutene conversion to the light olefins or aromatics readily occurs over Brønsted acid sites, further leading to low selectivity of target product or a short-lived catalysts owning to coke deposition. Subsequently, Lewis acid catalysts have been found highly active in the acetone conversion to isobutene, and simultaneously mitigate the isobutene isomerization and undesirable polymerization/coke reactions. Sun et al. [8,21] synthesized Zn x Zr y O z catalyst containing Lewis acid-base pairs applied in the acetone conversion, thus obtaining high selectivity of isobutene with a distinct improvement for catalyst stability in comparison with the Zn x Zr y O z catalyst with Brønsted acid. Very recently, Wang continually designed a CeSnBeta catalyst featuring dual Lewis acidic sites for the acetone conversion to isobutene, showcasing more enhanced stability compared with Zn x Zr y O z catalyst containing Lewis acid-base pairs [22]. In our previous work, we have designed Y species confined in silicious Beta zeolite with Lewis acid sites, displays a state-of-art isobutene yield and remarkable stability for acetic acid conversion to isobutene as well as acetone conversion to isobutene [23]. Moreover, the addition of water could mitigate the severe deactivation of catalysts through suppressing side reactions [11,24]. Nevertheless, the catalyst lifetime could be prolonged efficiently through modification of numerous Lewis acid sites and/or an appropriate amount of cofed water, but deactivation problem is still out of control. In spite of the substantial achievements made until now, the catalyst stability with Lewis acid sites remains a pivotal issue for acetone to isobutene conversion and the reason for catalyst deactivation is still unclear. A detailed deactivation mechanism of acetone to isobutene conversion is pivotal for subsequent catalyst design and, therefore, the primary objective of the work. In this work, Y/Beta prepared via impregnation method was used to disclose the deactivation mechanism in the acetone to isobutene conversion as a model catalyst. The catalytic performance of Y/Beta at different temperatures was measured on a fixed-bed reactor. Then, acetone-temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) experiments,13C cross polarization magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (CP MAS NMR) spectroscopy, in situ ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were utilized to concurrently monitor the organic intermediates occluded in the catalyst and the dynamic changes on the catalyst surface. The deactivation mechanism was then discussed in depth based on the catalytic and spectroscopic results. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation Commercial H/[Al,Si]Beta zeolite with a nominal n SiO2/n Al2O3 ratio of 27 was utilized as a precursor in the production of [Si]Beta catalysts. To obtain dealuminated [Si]Beta, H/[Al,Si]Beta zeolite was added to nitric acid solution with continuous stirring at 373 K for 12 h. The above product was separated by filtration and washed with deionized water until PH of the solution was neutral. Afterward, the resulting powder was dried at 473 K overnight. Completely dealuminated [Si]Beta was used to synthesize Y/Beta by the impregnation method. Afterward, 1.0 g of [Si]Beta was impregnated with yttrium nitrate. Typically, the metal precursor was dissolved into an appropriate amount of water, and [Si]Beta was then added and stirred for 8 h. The slurry was well mixed before being dried by evaporation in a hot water bath at 353 K. The dried product was calcined at 823 K for 6 h in air. For reference, Y2O3 was prepared from the yttrium nitrate solution. 2.2. Catalytic evaluation The acetone reaction was performed in a fixed-bed reactor under atmospheric pressure. 0.2 g of the Y/Beta catalyst (sieve fraction, 0.2–0.4 mm) was placed in a quartz reactor (i.d. = 5 mm) and activated at 723 K for 1 h under flowing nitrogen. After adjusted to the reaction temperatures, acetone was added into the system at a rate of 0.2 mL/h, corresponding to the weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 1/h. An online gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a Poraplot Q-HT column (40 m × 0.18 mm × 0.18 μm) to analyze the gaseous products. Thermal conductivity detector (TCD) with TDX-01 packed columns was used to detect CO2, CO, and CH4 in the products. CH4 was utilized as a ligament to calibrate the percentage composition of CO x and hydrocarbons. 2.3. Acetone TPSR The acetone TPSR experiments were carried out on a fixed-bed reactor with the downstream gas entering into mass spectrometer (MS, Pfeiffer-Balzer Omnistar). Nitrogen was utilized as the carrier gas. Typically, 0.1 g of Y/Beta was added to a fixed-bed reactor, preheated at 723 K for 1 h with a nitrogen flow of 20 mL/min, and then cooled to 298 K. Subsequently, acetone was continuously added to the catalyst bed as the reaction temperature was raised from 298 to 700 K with a heating rate of 5 K/min. In the TPSR investigations, the reaction products were simultaneously seen by MS. Querying by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the m/z values of the reactant and products were referred to as acetone (58), hydrogen (2), water (18), carbon dioxide (44), diacetone alcohol (59), mesityl oxide (83), and isobutene (41). 2.4. In situ ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy UV-vis spectra were recorded via a PerkinElmer Lambda 750 UV-vis-NIR spectrometer equipped with an in situ reaction chamber. In diffuse reflection mode, the UV-vis spectra were recorded between 200 and 800 nm. 20 mg of Y/Beta molecular sieve was placed in the sample cell and activated at 673 K for 1 h in flowing argon gas (20 mL/min) before the UV-vis tests. Then UV-vis tests were carried out in an acetone atmosphere. 2.5. Solid-state13C CP MAS NMR measurements A Bruker Avance III spectrometer was used for the solid-state MAS NMR studies, with resonance frequencies of 100.6 MHz for13C nuclei, respectively. The samples were dehydrated and pretreated at 673 K in a fixed bed for the13C MAS NMR experiments. Acetone-2-13C (99.5%13C-enriched, Sigma-Aldrich) was then loaded for additional research. For the following text, materials are moved into the gastight MAS NMR rotors after being moved into a glovebox that has been dry nitrogen-purged to prevent contact with air. 2.6. GC-MS analysis The organic compounds were detected by GC-MS. A total of 0.1 g of the catalyst was dissolved in HF solution for 12 h. The organic components were extracted using CH2Cl2, and the residual water was removed by adding enough solid sodium sulfate. Then, 0.1 μL of the organic extract was analyzed by GC-MS (GC-MS-QP2010 SE) with an RXI-5MS column. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Catalytic performance of the as-prepared catalysts The Lewis acidity of the as-prepared Y/Beta zeolite could be found in our previous results [23]. Then, the acetone to isobutene conversion over Y/Beta, [Si]Beta and Y2O3 was initially conducted in a fixed-bed reactor under different temperatures for a time-on-stream (TOS) of 30 min, and the results are given in Fig. 1 . It is clear that the reaction temperature makes a strong impact on the catalytic performance. A progressively upward trend of acetone conversion with the increase of reaction temperature was discovered for all the catalysts. For Y/Beta, mesityl oxide and CO2 are observed as the dominant products at low temperatures of 573–673 K. Upon increasing the reaction temperature to 723 K, other products including methane, 1-butene, and propylene start to occur. According to previous studies [25,26], these products could be originated from acetic acid decarboxylation, isobutene isomerization and cracking. With respect to [Si]Beta, it is obvious that high temperature is beneficial for mesityl oxide cracking. Different from Y/Beta and [Si]Beta, mesityl oxide is the dominant product over Y2O3, implying that aldol condensation of acetone can occur over Y2O3 and the further cracking of mesityl oxide cannot happen. This further demonstrates that silanol groups play a crucial role in mesityl oxide cracking. At high temperature of 673–773 K, small quantity of isobutene appeared at the expense of mesityl oxide, indirectly indicating that mesityl oxide is an intermediate in the acetone to isobutene conversion. Simultaneously, other products also occurred and the result is identical with the product selectivity of Y/Beta. The catalytic performance of both fresh and regenerated Y/Beta catalysts at various reaction temperatures was further evaluated, and the results are given in Fig. 2 . The acetone conversion and product selectivities could be well recovered after the regeneration both at low and high temperatures. At 623 K, the acetone conversion shows a slight decline for ca. 5% during the TOS of 15 h. Tiny amounts of aromatics and unsaturated aldehydes/ketones, such as mesitylene and isophorone, due to aldol condensation and cyclization of acetone, also occur in the products (Fig. S1(a)) [27]. At 723 K, an obvious decrease of acetone conversion for ca. 20% could be observed (Fig. 2(b)). Moreover, the selectivities of other products are slightly more than that at 623 K. Thereinto, methane, ethylene, propylene, isobutene and aromatics as well as unsaturated aldehydes/ketones are involved in the other products (Fig. S1(b)). This clearly reveals that high temperature is prone to the cracking, isomerization and cyclization of isobutene [28,29]. Furthermore, the XRD patterns of the catalysts before and after reaction, as well as the regenerated catalysts are displayed in Fig. S2. Typical diffraction peaks characteristic corresponding to BEA topology are identified for the aforementioned three catalysts, suggesting that the framework structure of Y/Beta catalyst was intact during acetone conversion to isobutene, and the deactivation was not owning to the destruction of zeolite structure. Furthermore, XPS analysis of these catalysts is also investigated (Fig. S3). The binding energy values of 160.5 and 158.4 eV corresponding to Y 3d 3/2 and 3d 5/2, respectively, are identical, demonstrating that the reason for catalyst deactivation is not the alteration of Y species valence states [30]. Additionally, no obvious agglomeration of Y particles could be observed over the spent Y/Beta catalysts after reaction for 10 h, indicating the Y species in the Y/Beta sample are very stable during acetone conversion (Fig. S4). Based on these results, we conclude that carbon deposits causing a gradual coverage of active sites or a blocking of pores might be responsible for the catalyst deactivation. 3.2. Acetone and intermediates TPSR experiments To gain deep insight into the reaction route of the acetone to isobutene conversion, TPSR experiments with acetone, diacetone alcohol and mesityl oxide were performed over Y/Beta catalyst under study (Fig. 3 ). With respect to acetone TPSR experiment (Fig. 3(a)), the acetone curve began to decline slowly at 373 K, while simultaneously the mesityl oxides and water curves inclined upward, suggesting that the dehydration reaction occurred. In addition, the variation trend of acetone was analogous to that of diacetone alcohol, due to the equilibrium reaction of acetone and diacetone alcohol [28,31]. Subsequently, a tiny increase of isobutene and CO2 was detected, suggesting that cracking reaction of mesityl oxide occurred. As the reaction temperature increased to 573 K, there was a noticeable decrease in the signals of acetone, diacetone alcohol, and mesityl oxide. Meanwhile, the variation trend of isobutene, CO2 and water curves were on the contrary. This finding suggests that acetone conversion was greatly improved. Additionally, the acetic acid initially emerged and subsequently descended on account of the ketonization of acetic acid [32]. In terms of diacetone alcohol TPSR experiment (Fig. 3(b)), the dehydration process of diacetone alcohol was demonstrated through the water curve beginning to grow at approximately 373 K, followed by the mesityl oxide exhibiting the same fluctuation trend. Isobutene began to form when the temperature reached 473 K, and the curves for acetone, diacetone alcohol, and mesityl oxide rapidly declined. Simultaneously, CO2 and acetic acid curves displayed the same upward trend and gradually reached an equilibrium, well supporting the occurrence of mesityl oxide cracking reaction ((CH3)2C=CHCOCH3 + H2O → CH3COOH + (CH3)2C=CH2). For mesityl oxide TPSR experiment (Fig. 3(c)), an obvious decrease of the signal of mesityl oxide occurs at 473 K, while the variation trends of isobutene and CO2 are in opposite. This indicates the occurrence of mesityl oxide cracking, thus resulting in the production of isobutene and CO2, in good agreement with the results of acetone and diacetone alcohol TPSR experiments. Afterward, the signals of acetic acid, acetone and diacetone alcohol also emerged, illustrating that acetic acid from the cracking reaction could undergo ketonization reaction and acetone is involved in the latter reaction. To summarize the aforementioned TPSR results, we came to the conclusion that acetone and diacetone alcohol rapidly reach the equilibrium reaction at low reaction temperature. Mesityl oxide is produced as a result of the dehydration process of diacetone alcohol. Subsequently, the cracking reaction of mesityl oxide occurs, giving rise to the formation of isobutene and acetic acid. Finally, the ketonization of acetic acid occurs and the formed acetone participates in the subsequent step, displaying a close agreement with the reaction network shown in Scheme 1. 3.3. In situ UV-vis spectroscopy of acetone conversion To infer the deactivation species over Y/Beta catalyst in the acetone to isobutene conversion, temperature-programmed UV-vis (TP-UV-vis) spectroscopy was further performed. The sample was purged with argon to eliminate the gas phase and physical acetone molecules following acetone saturation at 303 K. Subsequently, the cell temperature was progressively increased from 303 to 773 K. Fig. 4(a) displays the UV-vis spectra that were obtained following the background (new catalyst) subtraction. At 303 K, a large band with a weak shoulder occurred at 280 and 230 nm, respectively. The former large band could be attributed to the weakly adsorbed acetone [23], while the weak shoulder is owing to the acetone dimer. When the temperature increased to 473 K, a new band assigned to diacetone alcohol occurred at about 260 nm, hinting to the occurrence of aldol condensation of acetone, in line with the TPSR results (Fig. 3). When the temperature sequentially increased to 523 K, an obvious band at 212 nm attributed to adsorbed acetic acid (n → Π*) occurred. This is indicative of the mesityl oxide cracking reaction, in harmony with the reaction network shown in Scheme 1. With the reaction temperature further rising to 623 K, two new bands could be assigned to high polymers and large unsaturated aldehydes/ketones, such as phorone and isophorone (acetone trimerization and further cyclization), which are formed from the successive aldol condensation of acetone, appeared at 309 and 348 nm [33,34]. In order to obtain more information on the intermediates at low and high temperatures in the acetone conversion, the nature of the organic intermediates generated during the acetone to isobutene conversion over Y/Beta catalyst at 423 K (Fig. 4(b)) and 623 K (Fig. 4(c)) with a TOS of 30 min was compared by in situ UV-vis spectroscopy. At 423 K, the UV-vis bands at 230 and 260 nm due to acetone dimer and diacetone alcohol (vide supra), respectively, can be observed, the intensities of which exhibit the increased trend. It clearly indicates that the occurrence of aldol condensation of acetone at 423 K. At 623 K, besides the aforementioned signals, new signals at 309 and 348 nm assigned to high polymers and unsaturated aldehydes/ketones also appeared, inconsistent with the results of TP-UV-vis spectroscopy (Fig. 4(a)). Accompanied with the increase of TOS, there was a noticeable improvement in the band intensities at 420 and 510 nm, hinting at the transformation of high polymers and unsaturated aldehydes/ketones into charged alkylated naphthalenes, also causing the catalyst deactivation [35–37]. According to the aforementioned in situ UV-vis results over Y/Beta catalyst, we come to the conclusion that acetone to isobutene conversion is initiated by acetone aldol condensation. At low reaction temperature, acetone aldol condensation is the main reaction. Upon increasing the temperature, the excessive condensation of acetone would occur, thus enhancing the accumulation of large unsaturated aldehydes/ketones and aromatic compounds, and causing the catalyst deactivation eventually. 3.4. Solid-state13C CP MAS NMR spectroscopy of acetone conversion Solid-state13C CP MAS NMR spectroscopy was further employed to compare the organic intermediates formed during the acetone conversion on [Si]Beta and Y/Beta catalysts at various temperatures (Fig. 5 ). For [Si]Beta catalyst, the physisorbed acetone-2-13C molecules at nonacidic silanol groups are responsible for the dominant signal at 215 ppm, whereas the non-13C-enriched methyl group of the acetone at 303 K is liable for the tiny signal at 30 ppm (Fig. 5(a)) [38]. Upon increasing the reaction temperature to more than 523 K, a new signal occurs at 172 ppm. According to the previous studies [39,40], it could be assigned to formate species, originated from acetone oxidation on the dehydrated catalyst. Additionally, a weak signal at 72 ppm owing to the aldol condensation products of acetone also occurred in the13C MAS NMR spectra [41], in consistent with the catalytic results of [Si]Beta catalyst at high temperature (Fig. 1). For Y/Beta catalyst, the signal at 225 ppm can be caused by acetone-2-13C adsorbed on Lewis acidic Y sites (Fig. 5(b)) [42]. It is worth noting that the signals at 73 and 211 ppm ascribed to aldol condensation products (e.g., diacetone alcohol) appeared at 323 K in comparison with 523 K on [Si]Beta, hinting to the higher aldol condensation activity over Y/Beta catalyst. Upon increasing the temperature to 473 K, a weak signal caused by unsaturated aldehydes/ketones (such as isophorone) occurred at 190 ppm, in line with the result of UV-vis spectroscopy (Fig. 4) [43]. In addition, the signal appeared at 182 ppm indicating that a trace amount of acetic acid emerged from the mesityl oxide cracking. Meanwhile, new signals at 137 and 32 ppm assigned to aromatic compounds (e.g., mesitylene) also appeared [44], hinting to the occurrence of successive aldol condensation, cyclization and dehydration. In addition, a broad signal at 205–230 ppm started to appear, which could be assigned to the aldol products from three or more acetone molecules. Upon increasing the reaction temperature, the amounts of the aldol products of acetone reflected by the intensity of the signal at 205–230 ppm increased first and then declined. While the amounts of large unsaturated aldehydes/ketones and acetic acid reflected by the intensity of the signal at 190 and 182 ppm gradually increased. Meanwhile, the signal at 137 ppm attributed to mesitylene vanished. This indicates that high reaction temperature is prone to the occurrence of successive aldol condensation to form the larger unsaturated aldehydes/ketones (such as isophorone) rather than mesitylene. For more information about surface species owing to time accumulation in the acetone conversion at different temperatures,13C CP MAS NMR measurements were examined for TOS of 30 min at 423 and 623 K (Figs. 5(c) and (d)). At 423 K, the intensities of the dominant signals at 211 and 74 ppm attributed to the short-chain aldol products (e.g., diacetone alcohol) gradually increased with the progress of the acetone conversion. Simultaneously, other bands at 199, 190, 160–150 and 137 ppm assigned to mesityl oxide, isophorone, phorone and aromatic compounds, respectively [44], also occurred and exhibited the same variation trend. This hints to the formation of dimers (diacetone alcohol and mesityl oxide) and trimers (phorones, isophorones and mesitylene). At 623 K, the intensity of signal at 211 ppm declined obviously, indicating the dimers, e.g., diacetone alcohol, are rapidly involved in the consecutive condensation. On the contrary, large amounts of unsaturated aldehydes/ketones (δ 13C = 190 ppm) and acetic acid (δ 13C = 182 ppm) are formed. These observations reveal that the consecutive condensation and cracking are easy to happen over Y/Beta at higher temperatures. With the increase of TOS, new signals at 30, 172, 165, and 152 ppm owing to methyl and carbonyl groups of unsaturated aldehydes/ketones also appeared and exhibited the similar the variation trend as that of the signal at 190 ppm, indicating acetone polymerization occurred [45]. In addition, it is evident that the mesitylene-attributed signal at 137 ppm at 623 K is weaker than that at 423 K, hinting that unsaturated ketone (isophorone) is prone to generation at high temperature, in consistent with the result of Fig. 5(b). To summarize the13C MAS NMR results, we conclude that acetone firstly undergoes aldol condensation to produce diacetone alcohol, and then converts to mesityl oxide via dehydration. Afterwards, cracking reaction of mesityl oxide occurs to generate isobutene and acetic acid, in line with the reaction route as shown in Scheme 1. In addition, low reaction temperature could promote the formation of short-chain aldol products and small amounts of aromatics, while high temperature could enhance the accumulation of large unsaturated aldehydes/ketones. The affiliation of the13C CP MAS NMR signals is shown in Table S1. 3.5. GC-MS analysis for the spent catalysts after acetone conversion The chemical composition of the organic compounds occluded in the catalysts after acetone conversion for TOS of 5–30 min at various temperatures was examined by GC-MS, and the obtained results are displayed in Fig. 6 . At low reaction temperature (423 K), diacetone alcohol, mesityl oxide and unsaturated ketones are the dominant deposits formed on the spent catalysts for TOS of 5 min. Thereinto, the carbon chain is extended to six carbons (acetone dimers) as a result of the aldol condensation and dehydration of two acetone molecules. Products with higher carbon numbers (C9 to C15), such as phorone and isophorone (acetone trimmers), could be produced by further cascade aldol condensations. It is worth noting that intramolecular condensations and ring-closing reactions would occur when the carbon chain increases to more than six carbons, such as 2,6-dimethyl-2,5-heptadien-4-one (phorone-A) to isophorone and 4,6-dimethylhepta-3,5-dien-2- one (phorone-B) to mesitylene [46]. Thus, trimethylbenzene formed from intramolecular condensations/ring-closing reactions is observed as the major organic species at TOS = 10 min besides the above three deposits, in good agreement with the catalytic performance of Fig. S1(a). When TOS is extended up to 30 min, 2,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde and small amount of large organic compounds, like naphthalene, also appeared. According to our previous study, 2,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde could be originated from self- and cross-condensation as well as cyclization of acetaldehyde and acetone [33]. Acetaldehyde could be originated from the acetic acid hydrogenation, and hydrogen could be formed from acetone decomposition at high temperature [47]. At high reaction temperature of 623 K, 2,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde and 3.5-xylenol are observed as the dominant organic species occluded in the spent catalysts apart from small quantity of C6 and C9 compounds (acetone dimers and trimers), even following a short TOS of 5 min. With increasing TOS of 10 min, the intensities of the consecutive aldol condensation products, such as isophorone and phorone, and aromatics gradually increased. In addition, the amount of 3,5-xylenol displayed obvious increasing trend. The production of 3,5-xylenol could be due to the decomposition of higher carbon number compounds (isophorone to 3,5-xylenol and methane) at high temperatures [46], which can be supported by the presence of methane in the products (Fig. S1(b)). Upon increasing the TOS to 30 min, isophorone, 3,5-xylenol and 2,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde became the dominant organic species, indicating cyclic unsaturated aldehydes/ketones and aromatics could be rapidly formed and accumulated at high reaction temperature. These species could strongly adsorb on the active sites and thus cause the catalyst deactivation. 3.6. Deactivation mechanistic interpretation in the acetone to isobutene conversion over the Y/Beta catalyst Based on the aforementioned catalytic and spectroscopic results, the overall reaction mechanism and deactivation route of the acetone to isobutene conversion over comprehensive insights into the generation of organic intermediates and the causes of deactivation over Y/Beta catalyst are summarized in Scheme 2 . As demonstrated by TPSR results, acetone undergoes aldol condensation and dehydration to form diacetone and mesityl oxide, which could also be supported by in situ UV-vis and13C CP MAS NMR results. Afterward, the cracking reaction of mesityl oxide to isobutene occurs as accompanied with the generation of acetic acid, which is supported by the13C MAS NMR results. At last, the formed acetic acid could be further transformed to acetone, and thus repeat the aforementioned cycle. The multistep reactions adhere to the widely recognized process of acetone to isobutene conversion, as illustrated in Scheme 1. At low temperature, the successive aldol condensation of mesityl oxide and acetone occurs, leading to the generation of 2,6-dimethyl-2,5-heptadien-4-one (phorone-A) and 4,5- dimetylhepta-3,5-dien-2-one (phorone-B) [19]. Intramolecular aldol condensations and ring-closing reactions would dominate in the generation of cycloalkenes and aromatics when the carbon chain exceeds six carbons. Therefore, phorone-A or phorone-B could proceed through ring-closing and intramolecular condensation to generate isophorone and mesitylene, respectively, as supported by Fig. 5(c) and Fig. 6(a). Subsequently, the generation of a small amount of 2,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde is due to self- and cross-condensation as well as cyclization of acetaldehyde and acetone. The formation of acetaldehyde was further confirmed by acetone TPSR (Fig. S5). Consequently, these unsaturated aldehydes/ketones and aromatics could strongly adsorbed on the active sites and gradually lead the catalyst deactivation. At high reaction temperature, the conversion of phorone-A to isophorone is much easier to occur in comparison with the conversion of phorone-B to mesitylene. Additionally, methane release of isophorone could also be promoted at high temperature, which can be supported by the production of 3,5-xylenol (Fig. 5(b) and Fig. 6) and the presence of methane in the products (Fig. S1). In addition, larger amounts of 2,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde are formed, as supported by GC-MS results (Fig. 6). Furthermore, a small amount of naphthalenes could also be formed, which might be originated from polymerization and cyclization of alkenes (i.e., isobutene) with the presence of weak acidic Si-OH or the trace number of BAS without complete dealumination. In comparison with a low reaction temperature, the large amounts of the aforementioned cyclic unsaturated aldehydes/ketones and aromatics formed at high temperature could strongly adsorbed on the active sites and thus lead to a rapid deactivation of Y/Beta catalyst in the acetone to isobutene conversion. Fortunately, the catalytic activity of the spent Y/Beta catalyst could be well restored by simply regeneration in an O2 atmosphere. Therefore, a better catalytic activity with a longer catalyst lifetime might be expected in future according to optimizing the dispersion and density of Y active sites. 4. Conclusions In summary, a series of complementary techniques, including MS, GC-MS, in situ UV-vis and13C CP MAS NMR spectroscopy, are utilized to clarify the deactivation process of Y/Beta catalyst during the acetone to isobutene conversion. Based on the catalytic and spectroscopic results, different deactivation processes could be observed at low and high reaction temperatures. At low temperature, intramolecular aldol condensations and ring-closing reactions are the dominant side reactions. Isophorone and mesitylene generated from intramolecular condensation and cyclization of phorone-A or phorone-B were observed as the main organic deposits. While at high reaction temperature, a rapid formation and accumulation of the larger cyclic unsaturated aldehydes/ketones and aromatics, e.g., isophorone and 2,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde could be observed. Additionally, 3,5-xylenol derived from isophorone decomposition could also be observed. These cyclic unsaturated organic species could strongly adsorb on the Lewis acidic sites, and thus cause the catalyst deactivation eventually. After a simple calcination, the coke deposits could be easily removed and the catalytic activity could be well restored.

        "dc:description": "The conversion of acetone derived from biomass to isobutene has attracted extensive attentions. In comparison with Brønsted acidic catalyst, Lewis acidic catalyst could exhibit a better catalytic performance with a higher isobutene selectivity. However, the catalyst stability remains a key problem for the long-running acetone conversion and the reasons for catalyst deactivation are poorly understood up to now. Herein, the deactivation mechanism of Lewis acidic Y/Beta catalyst during the acetone to isobutene conversion was investigated by various characterization techniques, including acetone-temperature-programmed surface reaction, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, in situ ultraviolet-visible, and13C cross polarization magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. A successive aldol condensation and cyclization were observed as the main side-reactions during the acetone conversion at Lewis acidic Y sites. In comparison with the low reaction temperature, a rapid formation and accumulation of the larger cyclic unsaturated aldehydes/ketones and aromatics could be observed, and which could strongly adsorb on the Lewis acidic sites, and thus cause the catalyst deactivation eventually. After a simple calcination, the coke deposits could be easily removed and the catalytic activity could be well restored.",
