An introduction of small amounts of molybdenum compounds (<0.1 wt.-%) considerably reduces the detrimental effect of carbon deposit formation and increases the activity of methane steam reforming. With larger amounts, one observes a decrease in the catalyst activity, although it is much smaller than the reduction of the coking rate. The properties of the Ni-Mo/A1203 catalysts depend on the hydrogen-steam ratio in the reaction mixture which affect the mean degree of oxidation and distribution of various molybdenum states on the surface. Keywords: Steam reforming catalysts; Mo doped Ni/A120~; Catalyst activity; Carbon deposition 1. Introduction The loss of catalysts activity during their operation is a phenomenon which is hard to eliminate. One of the causes of the deactivation of nickel catalysts in the reaction of hydrocarbons steam reforming is coking. The formation of carbon deposits is particularly undesirable just in this reaction because the deposits have the form of carbon filaments and they mechanically destroy the catalyst. Several ways of preventing this undesirable phenomenon have been proposed [1-3]. Most often the resistance of nickel catalysts to coking was increased by introducing * Corresponding author.

Borowiecki et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 153 (1997) 141-156 various compounds of potassium [1,4-7], alkaline earths (MgO, CaO, BaO) [1,7,8], or metals of rare earths [9-11]. However, the application of promoters (with the exception of cerium compounds [10]) or a partial poisoning of the catalysts with sulphur, proposed by Rostrup-Nielsen [ 12,13], causes a considerable decrease in the specific activity of nickel [1,2,5,14]. Borowiecki et al. [15,16] have shown that the introduction of small amounts (0.5-2.0 wt.-%) of molybdenum or tungsten compounds into the nickel catalysts greatly improved their resistance to coking in the reaction of n-butane steam reforming. At the same time, in the case of the catalysts with an addition of 0.5 wt.- % WO3 or MOO3, they observed no decrease in the activity in a standard pressure test in the reaction methane steam reforming. Among the many literature concerning the Ni-Mo(W) catalysts only a few studies were found which would not involve hydrodesulphurization. These studies examined the possibility of increasing the resistance to sulphur poisoning of catalysts containing comparable amounts of NiO and MoO3 [17-20]. The growing interest in supported catalysts Me-Mo (Me = Rh, Ru, Pt) observed most recent results from considerable changes in their activity and selectivity in such reactions as hydrocarbons hydrogenolysis [21-23] or the hydrogenation of CO to oxygenates [24-26]. However, an explanation of the observed effects in such complex catalytic systems is very difficult. In an interesting paper by Hercules et al. [27], concerning the course of the reduction of much simpler systems MOO3/ A1203 or WO3/AI203, the authors state \"the lack of adequate means for measuring the distribution of Mo or W oxidation states.\" Studies [27,28] have shown that, after reduction at temperatures 350-850, the MoO3/A1203 catalyst may contain from 3 to 5 forms of molybdenum in various degrees of oxidation. And yet the distribution of Mo at various oxidation degrees depends not only on the reduction conditions but also on the temperature and conditions of the reaction. The situation is even more complex in NiO-MoO3/A1203 catalysts. The number of processes which may take place during various stages of the catalysts prepara- tion (calcination, reduction) or during their work under various reaction conditions is, after all, much greater. Examining the course of the reduction of the catalysts of hydrodesulphurization by method of TP Reduction, Laine et al. [29] demonstrate (at least for the case of catalysts calcined at 400 and 500) that Mo and Ni phases reduce independently of each other. However, they also show that the reduction of each of these phases is accelerated by the presence of the other phase. The role of Ni in accelerating Mo reduction may consist in facilitating the activation of hydrogen and its migration to a molybdenum compound in the \"spill-over\" process [29,30]. Also the mode of the preparation of NiO-MoO3/A1203 catalysts (the order of impregnation) affects their reducibility [31]. Examinations in Ni-Mo/carrier catalysts [20] and the course of nickel molyb- denate reduction [32] imply a possibility of the formation of Ni-Mo alloys whose amounts and composition depend, among others, on the presence of steam in the gaseous phase. Z Borowiecki et al./Applied Catalysis A.\" General 153 (1997) 141-156 143 Promoter distribution on the catalyst surface (and, hence, also the magnitude of the effect resulting from its presence) depends on the kind and properties of the cartier, composition of the catalyst and the mode of its preparation. The available information about molybdenum distribution in catalysts is most often very limited. For catalysts Pt/SiO2, promoted with ammonium heptamolybdenate, Meriau- deau et al. [21 ] and Leclercq et al. [22] have shown that, at least for small additions of molybdenum precursor (molybdate), it is preferentially adsorbed on the platinum surface rather than on silica. After reduction and outgassing in vacuo or in the conditions of butane hydrogenolysis, the molybdenum species seem to stay at the surface of platinum. Similar results have been obtained for the M/Rh/ SiO2 system, where M is an oxophilic element (Mo, Mn, Zn) [33,34]. Data on M/Rh/A1203 catalysts are less unequivocal, probably because of strong interactions, for instance, between MoO3 and aluminium oxide [35,36]. Kip et al. [37] suggested that MoO3 interacts only with the cartier, yet later studies by other authors confirmed the presence of MoO3 on the surface of the active metal [24,25,35,38,39]. Storm et al. [25,35] have demonstrated that in impregnated Rh-Mo/7-A1203 catalysts mixed metallic particles are formed whose surface composition depends on the reducing or non-reducing environment; rhodium is concentrated on the surface when the atmosphere is reducing, and molybdenum is concentrated on the surface when the atmosphere is non-reducing. The behavior of Me-Mo/carrier catalysts in various reactions indicates a possibility of changes in the composition of their surface (Me : Mo ratio) depend- ing on the conditions of the process, i.e., temperature and/or composition of the gas phase [22,25,39]. The present paper is a continuation of our studies on the effect of very small amounts of molybdenum promoter (_>0.02 wt.-%) on the properties of nickel catalysts of the steam reforming of hydrocarbons and the effect of the composition of the reaction mixture (H20 : H2 ratio) on catalytic activity and coking resistance. The effect of Mo on the rate of catalyst coking was also examined in n-butane hydrogenolysis in order to evaluate their properties in a reaction taking place in a gas mixture containing no water vapour. 2. Experimental 2.1. Samples examined Catalysts with varied amounts of the MoO3 promoter were studied. Catalysts denoted henceforth as Ni-Mo(-) (the number in brackets denotes the amount of MoO3 in wt.-%) are samples of a commercial catalyst Ni/c~-AI203 of the steam reforming of natural gas [40], impregnated with a solution of ammonium hepta- molybdate and containing 0.02-2.0 wt.-% of MoO3. After impregnation, the samples were dried at 105 and then calcined at 450 for 4 h. 144 T. Borowiecki et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 153 (1997) 141-I56 2.2. Methods The total surface area of the samples was determined by physical adsorption of argon at the temperature of liquid nitrogen in a static- volumetric apparatus which ensured a vacuum better than 210-5 hPa. The area surface of Ni was determined by hydrogen chemisorption at 20 and 100 mm Hg pressure (after the reduction of catalysts), assuming that chemisorp- tion stoichiometry was H:Ni =1:1 and the surface area occupied by one hydrogen atom equalled 0.065 nm2 [41]. Mean dimensions of nickel crystallites, dx, were determined by X-ray line broadening at angles 20=44.4 after Warren, by using a diffractometer DRON-2, CuKo~ radiation and a nickel monochromator. Studies of the catalysts coking were carried out by the gravimetric method in a flow reactor at atmospheric pressure, under conditions presented in greater detail elsewhere [14,42]. The formation of the deposit is preceded by a period of the so-called induction time of coking [1,10,18] whose length depends on many factors [43]. After the induction time, coking accelerates and the coking rate reaches a constant value. The following examinations of the coking at 500, constant partial pressure of n-butane (6.1 kPa) and constant flow rate of the reaction mixture (500 cm3min- 1) have been performed: the coking rate in the reaction of steam reforming of n-butane at various ratios of reagents using preliminary coked samples (up to 4 wt.-% carbon), the length of the induction period and coking rate in the reaction of steam reforming or hydrogenolysis of n-butane at selected ratios of the reagents, the rate of catalyst coking in the reaction of butane steam reforming at the mole ratio H20:C =1.5, in reaction mixtures supplemented with the appropriate amounts of nitrogen or hydrogen to achieve a constant flow rate. The catalytic activity of samples in the steam reforming of methane was measured in a differential reactor at low pressures of the reagents. In a quartz reactor of 6 mm in diameter the studied catalyst was placed. The size of catalyst grains was 0.16-0.25 ram, and the catalyst was diluted with such an amount of c~- A1203 to get the layer of 6 mm. The grains of ol-A1203 had the same diameter as the catalyst. After reduction at 800 the catalyst was cooled in a hydrogen stream to 600. A reaction mixture (40 dm3 h-1 at STP) containing about 0.5% CH4, 1% H2 and 1% H20 in nitrogen was fed to the reactor. Activity measurements were taken at the temperatures of 600, 550 and 500. Post-reaction gases were analyzed on the chromatograph PU-4500 (Philips) with a methanizer of CO and CO2 and a FID detector. The reaction rate divided by methane concentration was assumed to constitute a measure of the catalyst activity. In independent measurements it has T. Borowiecki et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 153 (19971 141-156 145 been determined that for the examined catalysts the reaction was of the first order in respect to methane. The effect of the ratio PH20 : PH: on the course of the reaction of methane steam reforming was also examined under similar conditions. In this case the reactor was fed with a reaction mixture (40 dm3 h-1 at STP) containing about 0.5% CH4, I% H,O and 1-30% H2 in nitrogen. The degrees of conversion of methane did not exceed 20, and effluent gas compositions were far from equilibrium conditions, including also the cases when reactions were carried out under high concentrations of hydrogen. 3. Results The properties of the catalysts after reduction in deoxidized and dried hydrogen (800 and 2 h) have been set up in Table 1. Under our experimental conditions, the monometallic catalyst containing 1 wt.- % of MoO3 does not chemisorb hydrogen. In order to calculate nickel dispersions it has been assumed that, even in the presence of Ni, molybdenum does not adsorb any hydrogen and the stoichiometry was H : Ni~s) = 1. The introduction of varied amounts of the promoter practically does not change the total surface area of the examined catalysts. The amount of chemisorbed hydrogen undergoes slight changes with the introduction of larger amounts of the promoter (_> 1.0 wt.-%). However, the mean sizes of nickel crystallites, determined by the method of X-ray diffraction line broadening, do not indicate any directed change in nickel dispersion. The notice- able discrepancy between dH and dx reported in Table 1 can be attributed to the poly-crystalline character of nickel particles.

Studies on catalyst coking in steam reforming 3.1.1. Coking in the \"steady-state\" period: The effect of the promoter amount Changes in the coking rates of catalysts with the added promoter, with various compositions of the reaction mixture expressed by the H20 : C (mol : atom) ratio, have been illustrated in Fig. 1. The introduction of even the smallest amount of MoO3 (0.02 wt.-%) to the unpromoted catalyst causes evident limitation of the coking rate. The resistance to coking of catalysts from the Ni-Mo series rises along with the growing amount of the promoter. The observed effect is also strongly dependent on the reagent ratio H20:C (Fig. 1). Increasing the amount of the addition 25 times (up to 0.5 wt.-%) has very small advantageous effect on the coking rate at the reagent ratio H20 : C =0.5. At the ratio H20 : C =2.0 (water vapour excess), such increasing of the amount of the promoter causes a lowering of the coking rate by two orders of magnitude. 3.1.2. The effect of the reaction mixture composition on coking parameters Rostrup-Nielsen [1] has formulated the dependence between the length of the induction period of coking and the amount of the deposit formed. The catalyst which does not undergo coking under certain conditions shows an infinitely long induction period. It has been shown [43] that the length of the induction period is affected by the same factors which influence the coking rate. For Ni and Ni-Mo (0.2) catalysts the increments of deposit weight formed in the reaction of n-butane steam reforming were determined with two ratios of reagents, namely, H20 : C =0.5 or 2.0. Table 2 presents the parameters of coking of both catalysts determined on the basis of sections of the plots corresponding to the \"steady-state of the coking rate.\" An addition of the promoter causes a decrease in the coking rate in a way which depends on the composition of the reaction mixture. T. Borowiecki et aL/Applied Catalysis A: General 153 (1997) 141-156 Table 2 Influence of reagent ratios on the coking parameters in the 'steady-state' of carbon 147 Catalyst Ratio of reagents Rate of coking Relative rate of coking Induction time (H20/C) (lag g~at lmin J) rNi_MJrNi /C~) (min) Ni 0.50 3978 28 Ni 2.00 312 122 Ni-Mo(0.2) 0.50 2810 70 38 Ni-Mo(0.2) 2.00 32 I 0 240 Similarly to preliminary coked samples, the effect caused by the presence of MoO3 very considerably increases with an excess of water vapour in the reaction mixture. When the reaction was carried out with the ratio H20 : C =0.5, the coking rate of the Ni-Mo (0.2) catalyst decreased by 30%. Under conditions of excess water vapour the observed coking rate was smaller by one order of magnitude and the induction period of coking was twice as long. An increase in coking resistance of Ni-Mo catalysts in the reaction of steam reforming depends on the amount of the promoter and the composition of the gas phase. 3.2. Studies on the course of coking in various n-butane reactions Fig. 2 presents changes in the weight of the catalysts of the Ni-Mo series connected with the formations of carbon deposits during the courses of two reactions of n-butane, namely, steam reforming with the reagents ratio H20 : CaHjo =2.0 (H20 : C =0.5), and hydrogenolysis with the reagents ratio H2 : C4HIo =2.0 (H2 : C =0.5).

An increase in the amount of MoO3 in the nickel catalyst causes a systematic decrease in the coking rate and a lengthening of the induction period in the reaction of steam reforming. On the other hand, no such effect of the amount of the promoter is observed in the reaction of hydrogenolysis. In the latter case the rates of deposit formation are higher than the one in the reaction of steam reforming, but they remain practically the same, regardless of the composition of the catalyst (the amount of the promoter). The parameters of the catalysts coking (coking rate and induction time) determined in both reactions (from the straight-line sections of the plots of changes in sample masses in time) are shown in Fig. 3. Studies carded out under the conditions in which the effects of the promoter on the coking rate in steam reforming (H20 : C =0.5) were weakest, showed that the catalyst Ni-Mo (2.0) was coked five times slower than the Ni sample. In the reaction of hydrogenolysis the same amounts of the promoter had practically no effect on the coking rate. It implies that the surface properties of composite catalysts Ni-Mo/A1203 change in various reaction mixtures. The decisive factors seem to be hydrogen partial pressure and its ratio to the pressure of water vapour. 3.3. The effect of hydrogen on coking rate Fig. 4 presents changes in the coking rates of Ni and Ni-Mo catalysts in butane steam reforming carded out in reaction mixtures (H20: C =1.5) supplemented with nitrogen or hydrogen, respectively. With changes in the composition of the reaction mixture (N2 ~ H2 ~ N2) the examined Ni-Mo catalysts behaved differently than the nickel sample. T.

The nickel catalyst displays properties which are different than those of Ni-Mo catalysts. The activity of the Ni catalyst gradually decreases when hydrogen content increases in the reaction mixture. However, evident changes appear only after exceeding 10 vol.% H2 in the mixture. Catalysts Ni-Mo were observed to show activity maxima on changes in hydrogen content. The range of hydrogen concentrations corresponding to a maximum depends on the content of molybdenum in the catalyst and it moves towards higher H2 content when the amount of the promoter rises. The activity of catalysts containing ->0.5 wt.-% MoO3 is smaller than that of the Ni catalyst within the whole range of hydrogen contents. Still, an increase in the amount of hydrogen causes their activity to gradually approach that of the nickel sample. 4. Discussion Catalysts with the Ni : Mo ratio of about 10 : 1 have been described in only two papers [44,45]. In a study conducted by Siri et al. [44] a slight increase in the amount of chemisorbed hydrogen on Ni(15)Mo(1.3)/A1203 sample was observed. For catalysts of the Me-Mo/carrier type a decrease in the amount of chemisorbed CO or H2 was observed, yet clear effect occurred in samples containing a large amount of Mo (Rh : Mo <1 : 3) [35] or Mo/(Mo + Pt) _>0.245 [22]). The data presented in Table 1 indicate that in samples containing -> 1 wt.-% MoO3 a slight decrease in the amount of chemisorbed hydrogen was observed. The results of studies in the coking rate of Ni and Ni-Mo catalysts, presented in Figs. 1-3 show that, in the reaction of steam reforming: an addition of even very small amounts of molybdenum compounds (0.02 wt.-%) causes a considerable decrease in coking rate (Fig. 1), 152 T. Borowiecki et aL /Applied Catalysis A: General 153 (1997) 141-156 the strongest effect on coking rate is exerted by small amounts of MoO3 (<_0.5%), changes in coking rate depend on the composition of the reaction mixture, hence, on the ratio of the reagents (Fig. 2, Table 2). The amount of MoO3 in the catalyst do not practically affect the coking rate in the reaction of n-butane hydrogenolysis (no steam in the reaction mixture) (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3). Studies on Ni-Mo catalysts in two test reactions make possible an evaluation of changes of surface properties of catalysts in different reaction conditions (mix- tures). The chemical probe, according to the Leclercq et al. [22], are very sensitive to the situation on the very top surface of catalyst. The literature data on the effect of molybdenum on the coking of Ni-Mo catalysts are few and contradictory; moreover, they concern the behavior of the catalysts in reactions other than hydrocarbons steam reforming. Laine et al. [46] tried to explain the inhibiting of carbon deposition on nickel-promoted Mo/A1203 systems for hydrodesulphurization by hydrogen activation and the spill-over effect. Bakes and Chludzinski [47] found that the metal oxides (MOO3, WO3 or Ta2Os) reduced the growth of filamentous carbon on Ni-Fe surfaces from the catalyzed decomposition of acetylene at temperatures >620. They explained the observed effect by a decrease in carbon solubility in metal crystallites (having no effect on carbon diffusion through the particles). Garden and Bartholomew [18] observed a 10-fold increase in the coking rate of catalyst 2.5Ni-3MoOx/A1203 in comparison with the sample without the promoter in CO methanation. No interpretation of the observed phenomenon has been offered by the authors of the study. For Ni-Mo/A1203 catalysts with the Ni : Mo ratio of about 10 : 1 it has been stated that Mo decreases the coking rate in the reaction of n-hexane cracking [45], while it has no effect on nickel specific activity in the reaction of methane reforming with CO2 [44]. These conclusions have not been confirmed by the results of our studies. The coking rate of Ni-Mo catalysts in reaction mixtures containing no water vapour (also in the reaction of n-butane decomposition [48]) does not depend on the presence and the amount of the promoter. On the other hand, the presence of the MoO3 promoter affects nickel activity in the reaction of methane steam reforming. However, it should be emphasized that the results obtained in studies [18,44,45] concern single catalysts with a molybdenum addition. Interesting conclusions are implied by Fig. 4 which presents changes in the coking rate of Ni and Ni-Mo catalysts in the reaction of butane steam reforming carried in mixtures with nitrogen or hydrogen. As expected, in the case of the Ni catalyst there occurs a lowering in the coking rate when nitrogen is replaced by hydrogen in the reaction mixture. An increase in hydrogen partial pressure (the gassifying factor) causes a lowering in the coking rate. A return to the atmosphere of nitrogen brings about another increase in the coking rate. Z Borowiecki et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 153 (1997) 141-156 153 Similar changes in the composition of the reaction mixtures (N2 ~ H2) for the Ni-Mo (0.1) and Ni-Mo (0.5) catalysts cause an increase in the coking rates of promoted catalysts. The magnitude of the observed effect increases for the sample with a larger content of MOO3. The presence of molybdenum in the catalyst eliminates the positive effect of hydrogen on the reduction of the coking rate of the nickel catalyst. In all the examined catalysts changes in the coking rates are reversible and occur in a very short time of several minutes. Differences in the coking resistance of Ni-Mo/AI203 catalysts resulting from changes in the ratios of water vapour and hydrogen in the reaction mixture, shown in Figs. 2-4 confirm the dynamics of the surface states of the examined catalysts discussed above. Water vapour probably stabilizes such MoOy forms on the catalyst surface which limit the course of the reaction of forming carbon deposits. Their number depends on the ratio PH2o : PH2, and also on the amount of the promoter (Figs. 2 and 4). In a reducing atmos- phere these states disappear (there appear other states MoOz in which z < y), and the properties of Ni-Mo catalysts cease to differ from the sample without the promoter. The effect of hydrogen partial pressure on the properties of Ni-Mo catalysts (and, hence, on the state of their surface) is also revealed by the results of the kinetic studies in the reaction of methane steam reforming. The observed complex dependence (Fig. 7) of the activity on the amount of hydrogen and composition of the catalysts (content of the promoter) implies a possibility of changes which may occur on the surface of the samples. Changes in the mean degree of oxidation and distribution of Mo states with different hydrogen concentrations in the reaction mixture [27,28] seem to constitute the most probable cause of the observed dependencies. With high hydrogen pressures (PH~ : pH20>20 : 1) the promoted samples become similar to the catalyst Ni/A1203. An analogous conclusion was indicated by studies in the coking rate in the reactions of steam reforming and hydrogenolysis of n-butane. More detailed interpretation of the influence of the hydrogen concentration on the steam reforming of methane requires conducting additional kinetic studies. However, taking into account all experimental results obtained and also the literature information, it seems that the molybdenum oxidation degree plays important roles as far as Ni-Mo catalysts are concerned. The presence of MoO3 in nickel catalysts changes their properties in the reaction of hydrocarbons steam reforming. Fig. 8 shows relative changes in the activity and coking rates of Ni-Mo catalysts (_<0.5 wt.-% MOO3). In the case of Ni-Mo catalysts containing less than 0.1 wt.-% of MoO3 a very considerable limitation of the course of the coking process was observed as well as an increase in its activity, especially evident at the temperature of 500. The presence of greater amounts of the promoter (>0.2 wt.-%) also proved advantageous in spite of a decrease in the specific activity, because the observed drop in the latter was much smaller than the changes in the coking rate. With an analogous composition of the reaction mixtures 154 T.

(ratio H20 : C =2.0) the specific activity of the Ni-Mo sample decreases by about 50%, whereas the coking rate decreases by two orders of magnitude. 5. Conclusions The promoting of the nickel catalysts of hydrocarbons steam reforming with small amounts of molybdenum compounds (about 0.5 wt.-% MOO3) brings about very interesting changes in their properties. Small amounts of the promoter (up to 0.1 wt.-%) cause an increase in proper activity and a rise in the catalyst resistance to coking. Although with a larger addition of MoO3 (about 0.5%) there occurs a drop in the activity, it is nevertheless much smaller than the decrease in the coking rate. The increase in coking resistance in the reaction of steam reforming caused by the promoter depends on the reagents ratio H20 : C. The properties of Ni-Mo catalysts depend on the kind of the atmosphere of the reaction. With high contents of hydrogen in the reaction mixtures, Ni-Mo catalysts become similar to the unpromoted sample. Such a behavior of the examined catalysts implies a high dynamics of the surface states in Ni-Mo samples and the dependence of the distribution of various MoOx states on the reducing or properties of the reaction mixtures.
