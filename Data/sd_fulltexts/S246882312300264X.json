Cu metal clusters loading on the surface of TiO2 served as co-catalyst can catalyze the reduction of CO2 to C2 products. However, the details mechanism of this reaction is still not clear. Moreover, finding other metal clusters to replace Cu is an attractive subject. In this work, the C-C bond forming mechanism by two CO* on several metal clusters (Cu, Ga, Co, Fe, Ni, Pt, Pd, Mo, and Zr) loading on TiO2 (101) surface (M10@TiO2) were investigated by climbing image nudged elastic band (cNEB) within density functional theory (DFT). We found the energy barrier of C-C bond forming on Cu10@TiO2 and Ga10@TiO2 is low around 0.7 eV which indicates that they are efficiency co-catalyst in CO2 reduction to C2 products. For other metal clusters, the energy barrier is large around 1.5 eV, and they are exclude comparing to Cu and Ga clusters. The reaction path to C2H4 has also been calculated on Cu10@TiO2 and Ga10@TiO2. The step energy on Ga10@TiO2 is all smaller than the energy barrier of C-C bond forming which makes Ga10@TiO2 may as be good as Cu10@TiO2. This work provides useful insights into the CO2 reduction to C2 products on metal clusters loading on TiO2 catalyst. Graphical abstract The Ga10@TiO2 has a lower C-C coupling energy barrier than the traditional Cu10@TiO2 system. It proposed that it has good catalytic performance in CO2 reduction to C2 products.

To combat fossil fuel dependence and reduce the greenhouse effect, the acquisition of a carbon-neutral energy supply system will ensure a sustainable future. Photocatalytic and electrocatalytic (using electricity form clean energy like solar energy or wide) conversion of carbon dioxide into high value- added chemicals and fuels, especially multiple carbon products, such as C2H4, is a promising way to address the energy and environmental issues [1–3]. Compare to C1 products, C2+ products like C2H4, have wider use and high added values which is of widely interesting to the industrial use [4]. However, C2 products usually have low selectivity or no selectivity in most catalysts which only shows C1 products [5,6]. Titanium dioxide TiO2 has many advantages in photocatalytic or electrocatalytic CO2 to fuels due to its mild reaction conditions, low cost, high stability, light corrosion resistance, and non-toxicity [7]. But, there is no C2 catalytic efficiency, or the efficiency is very low only using TiO2 as catalyst [6]. Loading metal nanoparticles as co-catalysts on the surface of TiO2 could improve its catalytic activity [8–10]. It is well-known that loading copper nanoparticles on TiO2 can remarkably improve its CO2 reduction activity and selectivity to C2H4 [11]. Hori et al. have reported that C2H4 is one of the two major products on Cu-based catalysts with high efficiency [12]. Varghese et al. have shown that the N-doped TiO2 nanotube array film covered by Pt and Cu nanoparticle could have increased the photocatalytic C2H4 production [13]. Charan et al. demonstrated that the Cu85 nanocluster can be very selective toward the C2 based products with lower limiting potential compared to the periodic surfaces [14]. Cu nanoparticle or Cu cluster loading on TiO2 have unique catalytic CO2 conversion to C2 products ability [15]. However, the underlying mechanism are still not clear. Besides, are there other metals cluster loading on TiO2 can catalytically convert CO2 to C2 products? In this work, we investigated the details of CO2 reduction to C2 products on Cu cluster and other metals cluster (M=Ga, Zr, Mo, Fe, Co, Ni, Pt and Pd) loading on TiO2 (101) surface (M10@TiO2 indicates the loaded metal cluster) by density functional theory. First, two CO* and CO* coupling to form C-C bond which is the most important step in forming C2 products are investigated using climbing image nudged elastic band (cNEB) [16]. We found the activation energy of two CO* coupling on Ga10@TiO2 is smaller than that on Cu10@TiO2. For other metal clusters, the activation energy to form C-C bond is high except Zr cluster which surfers from producing *CO. However, it is difficult to reduce OH* radicals on Zr10@TiO2. Then the whole path from CO2 reduction to C2H4 were provided on Ga10@TiO2 and Cu10@TiO2. Our works show Ga10@TiO2 may also be a promising catalyst in CO2 reduction to C2 products. The rest of the work is organized as following, in Section 2, it is the computation details, and in Section 3, we give the results and discussions, and the conclusions are summarized in Section 4. 2 Computational details Spin-polarized DFT calculations were carried out using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [17,18]. The projector augmented wave (PAW) method [19] was used to describe the core electrons, and a plane-wave kinetic energy cutoff of 500 eV was utilized to treat the valence electrons. Convergence criteria of total energy and force were set to 1 × 10−4 eV and 0.02 eV/Å, respectively. The Brillouin zone was sampled with the gamma point for geometry optimization. Due to incomplete self-interaction cancelation for transition metals, the DFT + U correction [20] was used for the d orbitals of Ti atoms in TiO2 with an effective Ueff value of 4.5 eV. For the Ueff values on Ti 3d, we take it from Material Project [21] of TiO2. For some metals, like Cu, Pt, Ga, there are only p and s electrons and no localized d electrons, therefore, we didn't include the Ueff correction. For other metals with d electrons, we add Ueff correction and take them from Material Project [21] of their metal oxides. The optimized lattice parameters for bulk anatase TiO2 were a=b=3.776 Å, and c=9.486 Å, which are in good agreement with the experimental data [22]. The anatase TiO2(101) surface was modeled using a 3 × 4 supercell with six atomic layers (144 atoms in total). A vacuum length of 15 Å was used to avoid the interaction between slabs. The structure is shown in Fig. S1 of SI. For the metal cluster, a neutral cluster including 10 atoms was used. Although it is a small cluster, it is a stereo structure, and the coordinate of the metal atoms could also be the similar as that in the metal nanoparticles [23]. For these metal clusters, we first optimize them in a 15 Å × 15 Å × 15 Å box and then put them on the surface of anatase (101) surface. The adhesion formation energy between cluster and TiO2(101) surface has been calculated by using Eq. (1), (1) E ads = E cluster @ TiO 2 − ( E cluster + E TiO 2 ) where Ecluster, ETiO2, and E cluster@TiO2 are the energies of cluster, TiO2(101) and cluster loaded TiO2 systems, respectively. To calculate two CO coupling to C-C bond, the climbing image nudged elastic band (cNEB) [16] was used. Five images were added between the initial and the finial structures. To calculate the path of CO2 conversion to C2H4, Norskov's CHE model is used [24]. The Gibbs free energies (ΔG) of the reaction were calculated by Eq. (2), where ΔE, ΔEZPE, T and ΔS are the electronic energy, zero-point energy, temperature and entropy [25]. (2) Δ G = Δ E + Δ E ZPE − − T Δ S The electronic energy was calculated by DFT while VASPKIT was used to determine entropy based on vibrational frequencies [26]. 3 Results and discussions 3.1 Adsorption of metal clusters on the anatase TiO2 (101) surface For the metal cluster, it must be a stereochemical structure and contains less atoms as this metal cluster will be supported on the TiO2 surface. For the literature [23,27-34], we found many metals having 10-atoms cluster. It is suitable to put these clusters on the TiO2 surface. First, is for the computational convenient. Second, it may also reflect the chemical insight comparing to the experiment. The metal clusters Cu, Ga, Zr, Mo, Fe, Co, Ni, Pt and Pd was selected. For Cu cluster, it is well known it is good cocatalysts for C2 products [15]. For Ga, Zr, and Mo, their metal cluster or oxidates are widely used in CO2 reduction [35]. The rest of the metal clusters also have good catalytic properties in hydrogen evolution or oxygen evolution reaction [36]. These metals are widely used in the experiment is one reason. For another reason, is that in Ga metal cluster, it is a d10 metal which is similar as Cu metal cluster. For Fe, Co, and Ni, there are d0 metal clusters and the price of these metals are cheap. They are also metals with magnetism. For Pt and Pd, there are noble metal and widely used as co-catalyst in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. For the Mo and Zr, although there are d0 metals, their behavior is quite different from Fe, Co, and Ni, and they are reported to be good CO2 reduction catalyst. The structure of metal clusters before and after loading on the TiO2(101) surface is shown in Fig. 1 . They are all easy to adsorb on the TiO2 surface forming a stable geometry. For some clusters, the geometry does not change much after loading on the TiO2 surface. But for Zr cluster, the shape distorted after loading on the TiO2 surface. The metal-cluster will be changed much comparing to that after it is supported on the TiO2. In the experiment, these metal cluster are served as co-catalyst and won't be used alone. Besides, in the calculations, we found that the interface formed by the metal clusters and TiO2 has important role in the CO2 reduction. The CO2 molecular is adsorbed on metal cluster and a Ti atom in the TiO2. Therefore, we did not do the calculations of CO2 reduction on the metal-cluster alone. 3.2 Adsorption and activation of CO2 to CO* on the M10@TiO2 CO2 adsorption is the first important step for CO2 to reduction [37]. For bare TiO2, the CO2 adsorption is very week and the CO2 molecule keep its linear geometry which is confirmed by both experimental [38]and theoretical works [39]. But after loading metal clusters on the TiO2, we found the CO2 adsorption becomes easy and its linear geometry bends to an angle as shown in Fig. 2 . For most of the clusters, CO2 molecule adsorbs on the interface of metal clusters and TiO2 surface. Only on Fe and Pt clusters, the adsorption occurs on the metal clusters. This indicates the interface play an important role in the CO2 adsorption. As shown in the Fig. 2(a), the CO2 is bind on both Cu cluster and a Ti atom in TiO2. The linear geometry of CO2 is bend indicating it is activated. On the pure surface of TiO2, the linear geometry of CO2 is not changed. From this point, we say the interface formed by Cu cluster and TiO2 has an important role in the CO2 adsorption. The adsorption energy and the geometry of CO2 molecules after adsorption on the M10@TiO2 are listed in Table 1 . Comparing to the bare TiO2 surface, the adsorption energies are all much negative and the angel of C-O-C of CO2 molecule are all much smaller than 180° From the adsorption energy, we find CO2 molecular is easy to adsorb on these structures. The linear shape of CO2 molecular all bends after absorbing on these structures which indicates CO2 is activated on M10@TiO2. For the CO2 adsorption, we also tried several other cases, like put the CO2 molecular close to the metal cluster. In all these cases, the linear shape of CO2 doesn't change which indicates it is physical adsorption. As shown in the Fig. 2, all the CO2 molecular bend to an angle and this configuration have much lower adsorption energy. CO* is a very important intermediate in the CO2 reduction. It is widely accepted that the C-C bond in C2 products is formed by two CO* intermediates [40]. Here, the CO* generated path is as following: (a) *+CO2→CO2* (b) CO2*+1/2H2→COOH* (c) COOH*+1/2H2→CO*+H2O Where * indicates the catalytic site. In the above equation, it is a CO2 hydrogenation process, and it also applies to CO2 photocatalytic reduction with 1/2H2 H++e− [24]. Here, we only use the limiting potential ΔE to describe the CO* forming. The step free energy diagram is shown in Fig. 3 . The optimized geometries of intermediates COOH* and CO* are shown in Fig. S2 in SI. The heat value of the reaction is shown in Table S2 of SI. For metal cluster Co, Pt, Ni, Mo on TiO2 surface, we found the ΔE is negative or close to zero which indicates the CO* will be formed spontaneity. On Fig. 3, it is the step free energy of CO2+*→CO2*→COOH*→CO*. From the figure, we found for metal cluster Co, Pt, Ni, Mo on TiO2 surface, the step energy is all downhill which means the reaction doesn't need the external potential energy ΔE and it can be formed spontaneity. On the metal cluster Cu for example, the largest step energy is from COOH* to CO* which is ∼0.2 eV. If applied an external potential energy 0.2 eV, all the steps are downhill. Here in our case, the external potential energy ΔE is the largest step energy. With the metal cluster Pd, Cu, and Ga, ΔE is ∼0.2 eV. For others Fe and Zr cluster on TiO2, ΔE is large. Form the limiting potential, we found that the cluster Pd, Cu, and Ga loading on TiO2 surface have good catalytic properties to form CO*. However, we didn't want the product to be free CO. We take CO* as an intermediates and use it for the following CO*-CO* to form C-C bond. 3.3 Two CO* coupling to form C-C bond on M10@TiO2 The mechanism of two CO* forming C-C bond is as following (d) CO*+CO*→CO*-CO* This mechanism is widely used and accepted [40]. Although there are other mechanisms to form C-C bond, such as COH*+CO* [41], this work does not consider them. In CO2 reduction to C2 products, there are many steps. The most important step is to form C-C bond. In this work, we investigated CO2 reduction to C2 products on 9 metal clusters supporting on the TiO2 surface. If consider all the step energies and transition state energies, it will be too much work. Therefore, we only investigate the transition energy in the C-C bond forming process. First, the energy diagram of two CO* forming CO*-CO* on Cu10@TiO2 and Ga10@TiO2 are shown in Fig. 4 . Here we only show the geometries of the initial, finial, and transition states, other geometries in the cNEB are shown in Fig. S3 in SI. On the Cu10@TiO2, we found the energy between the initial and finial state are almost the same, and there is an energy barrier ∼0.77 eV between the initial and finial state. In the initial state, one CO* binds on the Cu site and another CO* binds on the Cu and Ti site. In the finial state, CO*-CO* adsorb on the interface between Cu10 cluster and TiO2 surface. On the Ga10@TiO2 surface, two CO* bind loosely on the Ga site and Ti site, and it is more like free CO. On the finial state, the CO*-CO* adsorb on the interface as similar as that on the Cu10@TiO2. The energy of finial state is much lower than the initial state. However, there is an energy barrier ∼0.44 eV between the initial and finial state. This barrier is much lower than that on the Cu10@TiO2. For coupling on Cu10@TiO2, the heat of reaction is ∼0.2 eV, with the external energy from light or electric field, it can be proceeded easily. Therefore, form the C-C bond forming point, the Ga10@TiO2 has advantage comparing to the Cu10@TiO2. For clusters Fe, Ni, Co, Pd, Pt on TiO2, their behaviors are the similar. The energy diagram and the geometries of the states in cNEB calculations are shown in the Fig. S4 in SI. The finial state has much high energy than the initial state, and the energy barrier is higher ∼ 2 eV which indicates C-C bond forming on them are difficult. For Pd, Cu, and Ga clusters, they are all good to form CO*. But we found on Pd cluster, the two CO* forming CO*-CO* has large overpotential higher than 2 eV. On Cu and Ga clusters, the overpotential of forming CO*-CO* is only 0.7 and 0.4 eV. Form this point, the Pd cluster is excluded. CO* adsorption is the important first step. If it is difficult to form CO*, there will be no further reaction to form C-C bond. On some cluster, we find it is difficult to form C-C bond and the reason may be on such clusters, the reaction is only taken place on the pure metal cluster. For the clusters which is easy to form C-C bond, we find the reaction occurs on the interface, like on Cu and Ga clusters. The CO*-CO* is absorbing on both metal cluster and a Ti atom in TiO2. This again indicates that the interface between the metal cluster and the supported materials play an important role in CO2 reduction to C2 products. For the Mo10@TiO2, the energy barrier is 1.36 eV which is much higher that on Cu10@TiO2, Ga10@TiO2 shown in Fig. 5 . For the Zr cluster on the TiO2 surface, we found the energy barrier is ∼0.71 eV as shown in Fig. 5 which is similar as on Cu10@TiO2, Ga10@TiO2. The geometries of states in the cNEB calculations are shown in Fig. S5 in SI. This indicates on Zr10@TiO2, the C-C bond forming is as easy as on the Cu10@TiO2. In the above section, we reported that the step energy of CO* forming on Zr10@TiO2 is ∼ 2 eV which is very high. This is contrast to the experimental finding that Zr or Zr oxides are good catalyst in CO2 reduction [42]. On Zr10@TiO2, in the CO* generating process, the limiting step is on Step 3, COOH*+1/2H2→CO*+H2O, reaction heat is 2.357 eV. However, we found in the Step 2, CO2*+1/2H2→COOH*, CO* is already generated and the COOH* is actually CO*+OH*, and the high overpotential is from OH*→H2O which is the removing OH* step. Therefore, for Zr10@TiO2, it may a good catalyst in CO2 hydrogeneration process as it usually in high temperatures and removing OH* is easy. But in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction process, it may be not a good catalyst. In summary, we found the experimental widely used Cu10@TiO2 has low energy barrier in forming C-C bond. In the experiment, the Cu cluster supporting on TiO2 is widely used as CO2 reduction to C2 products. In the work, we found that the CO*-CO* forming C-C bond on Cu10@TiO2 has a low barrier about 0.7 eV. The calculated results in somehow consistent with the experimental finding. This indicates by calculating the barrier of C-C bonding forming could capture the essence part of the CO2 reduction to C2 products. And we could use this method to screen other metal clusters and hope can find several metal clusters could replace Cu cluster. The Ga10@TiO2 has similar behavior as Cu10@TiO2 which ban be used to produce C2 products both in photocatalysis and tradition catalysis. The barrier for C-C bond forming on Zr10@TiO2 has the same order as on Cu10@TiO2. But it has high step energy to remove the OH* and it may serve as a good catalyst in tradition CO2 hydrogenation. For other metal usually serve as good hydrogen evolution catalyst, such as Fe, Ni, Co, Pd and Pt, they have difficult to forming C-C bond. 3.4 Reduction of CO2 to ethylene C2H4 on Cu10@TiO2, Ga10@TiO2 For the above section, we found that Cu10@TiO2, Ga10@TiO2 has potential to form C2 products. In this section, we investigate the reduction of CO2 to C2H4 on these two systems. Form CO2 reduction to C2H4, there are 12 electron and proton transfer, and the intermediates are more than 12. But here, the start point is with CO*-CO* on these two clusters. And only the intermediates with low step energy, are calculated. The step free energy of CO*-CO* forming C2H4 on Cu10@TiO2, Ga10@TiO2 are shown in Fig. 6 . The geometries of all the intermediates are shown in the Fig. S6 in SI. The heat value of C2 intermediate reaction is shown in Table S3 of SI.We found on the Cu10@TiO2, there are only three steps are uphill and the large step energy is ∼0.89 eV which is slightly larger than the energy barrier for C-C bond forming. On the Ga10@TiO2, only one step is uphill with the step energy is ∼0.37 eV that is small than the C-C bond forming. For this point, we found that Ga10@TiO2 may be better than Cu10@TiO2 in CO2 reduction to C2 products. 4 Conclusion In this work, using DFT calculation, we studied the CO2 reduction to C2 products on metal clusters loading on TiO2 (101) surface. The 10 atoms metal clusters Cu, Ga, Co, Ni, Fe, Pt, Pd, Mo, and Zr are all easy to adsorb on the TiO2 (101) surface. CO2 molecules prefer to adsorb in the interface between the metal clusters and TiO2 surface, and its liner geometry bends largely. The step energy from CO2 reduction to *CO are all small except on Fe and Zr clusters. On Zr10@TiO2, *COOH species dissociate to *CO and *OH, and removing of *OH need large step energy. The energy barrier of forming C-C bond by two CO* are smaller than 0.7 eV on (Cu, Ga, and Zr)@TiO2. For other metal clusters, the barrier is large. The reaction path to form C2H4 prefers on Ga10@TiO2, and all the step energies are smaller than 0.4 eV. We propose that Ga10@TiO2 may be good catalyst which could replace Cu10@TiO2 in CO2 reduction to C2 products. For Ga10 cluster loading on TiO2 may not be difficult to synthesis in experiment as many single atom metals catalytic site can be synthesized in current experiment. This work present here can provide a way for experiment to design catalysts toward CO2 reduction to C2 products.

        "dc:description": "Cu metal clusters loading on the surface of TiO2 served as co-catalyst can catalyze the reduction of CO2 to C2 products. However, the details mechanism of this reaction is still not clear. Moreover, finding other metal clusters to replace Cu is an attractive subject. In this work, the C-C bond forming mechanism by two CO* on several metal clusters (Cu, Ga, Co, Fe, Ni, Pt, Pd, Mo, and Zr) loading on TiO2 (101) surface (M10@TiO2) were investigated by climbing image nudged elastic band (cNEB) within density functional theory (DFT). We found the energy barrier of C-C bond forming on Cu10@TiO2 and Ga10@TiO2 is low around 0.7 eV which indicates that they are efficiency co-catalyst in CO2 reduction to C2 products. For other metal clusters, the energy barrier is large around 1.5 eV, and they are exclude comparing to Cu and Ga clusters. The reaction path to C2H4 has also been calculated on Cu10@TiO2 and Ga10@TiO2. The step energy on Ga10@TiO2 is all smaller than the energy barrier of C-C bond forming which makes Ga10@TiO2 may as be good as Cu10@TiO2. This work provides useful insights into the CO2 reduction to C2 products on metal clusters loading on TiO2 catalyst.",
