With pure alumina, ageing has a tremendous effect on both the surface area of the support and metal dispersion which induces severe loss of activity. High temperature calcination of Pt-Ba/A1203 samples leads to a solid state reaction leading first to BaO - AI203, then to BaO 6A1203. The latter phase is strongly heat resistant inhibiting ot-Al203 transformation. Despite surface area preservation, platinum is not stabilised on this support: metallic dispersion is very low, as evidenced by the formation of very large particles. Unexpectedly, activity is enhanced on such sintered catalyst. Some hypothesis concerning active species have been proposed to explain this activity enhancement. It is suggested that some kind of mobile superficial oxygen atom may be responsible for the activity. Keywords: Catalytic combustion; Ageing; Thermostability; Platinum; Alumina; Barium addition I. Introduction In the first part of this study [1] it was shown that introduction of barium onto alumina led to strong modifications of both the support and the active phase.

Labalrne et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 138 (1996) 93-108 whereas the electronic structure and the catalytic properties of platinum in butane combustion are modified. The main results were: 1. a decrease in the activity in the presence of barium, due to a partial metal covering by BaO, 2. a slight activation of Ba-loaded catalysts under reactants, which can be attributed to a re-exposure of surface platinum atoms previously covered by BaO. In the case of butane combustion, used for example in catalytic burner or boilers, high temperatures (0> 1000) along with huge amounts of steam always produce severe sintering of the support and active phase, leading to the deactivation of the catalysts. For high temperature combustion reactions, the support stability is a prerequisite. It is known that introduction of barium is very valuable for stabilizing alumina [2]. Formation of barium hexaaluminate is efficient to maintain specific areas of 10 to 20 mR/g after calcination at 1200-1400 [3,4]. These supports may be very attractive for a high temperature application. Such solids can be used for supporting noble metals. Ageing of catalysts, for which support has got new sintering resistance, has also to be experienced: the effect of the properties of support may influence that of the active phase. This is the aim of the present paper. 2. Experimental The experimental data concerning the preparation of catalysts, the physico- chemical characterisations and the catalytic activity measurements conditions have been described in the first part of this work [1]. The three catalysts will be referred to as Pt/A1203, Pt/Ba*A1203 and Pt/Ba\" \"A1203, where Ba* and Ba* * stand for low (7.6 wt.-% Ba) and high (15.3 wt.-% Ba) barium loadings respectively, they contain the same amount of platinum (ca. 2.5 wt.-%). Ageing procedure has been performed in a quartz reactor loaded with 2 g of the reduced catalysts. The sample bed had a cylindrical form of 35 mm diameter and 10 mm height. The solid was aged during 5 and 20 h at 1200 under a gas mixture consisting of N2/air/H20 in the relative ratios 80/5/15 in volume, with a total flow rate of 12 1/h. This mixture is supposed to represent the composition of the exhaust gases issued from a catalytic burner fuelled with butane, working with an excess of air. The total combustion of butane (Eq. (1)) in air, considering that air contains 21 vol.-% 02 and that a slight oxygen excess (5 vol.-%) is necessary to avoid partial oxidation, can bum a maximum of 3 vol.-% Call t0 with respect of the stoichiometry of the reaction.

Labalme et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 138 (1996) 93-108 95 The gases issued from this reaction, when all butane has been consumed, contain mainly N2, the excess 02, the 15 vol.-% water formed by the combus- tion of 3 vol.-% butane and CO2. This accelerated ageing procedure (heating at 1200 for 5 or 20 h on stream) is supposed to simulate long working periods in operating conditions. Aged catalysts were characterized by several physicochemical methods (X-ray diffraction, surface areas (BET) measurements, TEM and STEM, H2/O2 titra- tions, FT-IR of adsorbed CO) in order to detect the modifications brought by the ageing procedure. Some other additional techniques have been used for solids characterization (XPS, TPR, etc.). After ageing, solids were tested again in the reaction of butane combustion, in the same conditions as described in part I [1]. Comparison of results obtained concerning catalytic activity along with physicochemical characterizations is expected to lead to the knowledge of surface properties of the aged catalysts. 3. Results 3.1. Surface areas Surface areas (BET) of the catalysts after ageing are reported in Table 1 and compared to the values for fresh solids. It is clear that introduction of barium is strongly beneficial as far as surface area conservation is concerned. For non-modified alumina, a strong sintering occurs after only 5 h of treatment: area decreased from 98 to 6 m2/g: only 6% of the initial BET area is maintained. Moreover, longer duration has almost no effect on sintering because the area only slightly decreases from 6 to 5 m2/g. Thus, the alumina sintering is achieved after a few hours. In the case of the two Ba-modified catalysts a 5 h ageing leads to a good preservation of the specific areas (65 and 53 m2/g compared to 89 and 71 m2/g in the fresh states). When comparing values for fresh catalysts with the 5 h aged ones, it seems that loss of area is comparable for catalysts containing barium: 73% (65/89) and 75% (53/71) of original areas is maintained suggesting that the kinetics of sintering are roughly the same. Such a conclusion is true after 20 h ageing: the percentages of remaining area are the same, i.e., 47% (42/89) and Table 1 BET areas according to the treatment (m2/g) Catalyst Fresh state Aged 5 h Aged 20 h Pt/Al203 98 6 5 Pt/Ba*AI203 89 65 42 Pt/Ba* * A1203 71 53 32 96 V.

One first conclusion is that barium modifies the sintering process and slows down the kinetics. 3.2. Crystallographic phases The crystallographic phases observed by X-ray diffraction are reported in Table 2, along with diffraction patterns illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2. For aged Pt/A1203, the only phase attributed to alumina was a-alumina detected by sharp peaks (Fig. 1A). The reduced noise and sharpness of peaks are in complete accordance with the low BET area. Lines due to metallic platinum are also clearly evidenced. For solids containing barium, lines due to metallic platinum are always evidenced revealing that large Pt crystallites are also present. No diffraction lines corresponding to c~-alumina are observed. This result is consistent with the values of BET areas: sintering is slowed down and transformation of \"y-Al203 into the a-form has been stopped. The formation of new phases is also evidenced. After 5 h ageing, lines due to BaA1204 [3] are observed because of a solid state reaction between BaO and A1203. Moreover, the peaks for high barium loaded solid are stronger which is in accordance with the presence of barium aluminate in higher concentration (Fig. 1B and Fig. 2A). Faint lines due to BaCO3 are also detected which are relevant to the reaction of atmospheric CO2 with BaO. When solids have been aged for 20 h, new peaks are observed (Fig. 2B) corresponding to the hexaaluminate structure BaO. 6.6 A1203 formed by reaction of barium aluminate with alumina [4]. Such a phase was always detected on the 20 h aged samples for both barium contents. A mean Pt particle size was calculated based upon the width of the XRD peak and after apparatus calibration for Pt particle size estimation [5]. Values are obtained within some errors because dispersions are very low, but on the whole they correspond to ca. 35 nm: this value is obtained for the three catalysts, whatever the presence or not of barium on alumina and whatever the ageing V.

As a first conclusion, the sintering of the metal is independent of that of the support: the same platinum particle sizes (ca. 35 nm) are observed for sintered alumina (support area: 6 m2/g) and for sintered Pt/Ba*A1203 (support area: 65 m2/g). 3.3. Electron microscopy Two solids, Pt/A1203 and Pt/Ba* *A1203, were studied by TEM and STEM after 5 h ageing at 1200 (Fig. 3A and Fig. 3B). For the Pt/A1203 catalyst (Fig. 3A), the strong sintering of both support and metal particles is clearly evidenced. The sizes of the support particles range from 200 to 300 nm, while for the metal an heterogeneous size distribution is observed, with particles in the 80-120 nm range corresponding to a dispersion of ca. 1%. Thus, for such a solid a tremendous sintering of the support and of the active phase has occurred. 98 V.

In the case of the barium-containing sample (Fig. 3B), a very different microscopic aspect of the catalyst is revealed. The support still consists in small particles, whose external aspect is not much modified compared with the same catalysts before ageing [1]: their size is only slightly larger suggesting some coalescence of alumina which leads to a support of lower specific surface area. STEM analysis reveals, as previously observed for the fresh catalyst, that the barium covering is preserved: the Ba/AI atomic ratio ranges from 0.032 to 0.2, while the chemical analysis leads to a bulk ratio of 0.067. Some darker zones, evidenced by TEM, are barium enriched. Concerning platinum, there is no difference between the two aged Pt/A1203 and Pt/Ba* *AI203 catalysts: a severe sintering of the metal has occurred leading to particle sizes of about 100 nm. It can be concluded that barium prevents the support from sintering by the formation of a new stable phase, whereas barium addition has no effect on the active phase sintering. V.

Fraction of accessible metal surface, from H2 / 02 titrations Metallic dispersions have been tentatively determined by hydrogen-oxygen titration. (Results are given in Table 3.) It can be noted that the fraction of accessible areas of platinum (preferably to dispersion) in the three aged catalysts are very low and within the limit of sensitivity of this method. This conclusion is in accordance with the observations with electron microscopy. This suggests 100 V.

FTIR study of adsorbed CO CO adsorption was used to monitor the state and dispersion of platinum. Nothing conclusive has been obtained. For CO adsorbed onto samples, faint bands in the limit of noise have been observed. In fact, according to the performance of the spectrometer (stray light, noise and its elimination by dedicated software) no definite conclusion can be drawn. That is the reason why FTIR will not be considered further in this paper. 3.6. XPS measurements Only spectra of the high barium loaded sample have been recorded. XPS measurements have been performed with a Escalab 200 R apparatus using A1 K ot as an X-ray source. All values were corrected according to the peak of pollution carbon normally located at 293 eV, which is observed in the present study at 284.6 eV. Acquisition was performed with 3 scans for lines corresponding to oxygen, 5 scans for A1 and Ba elements, 20 for C and 80 for Pt. As the Pt 4f lines are too close to the A1 2p ones [6] no fitting could be operated efficiently by resolving lines of aluminium and that of platinum. We chose to examine the small Pt doublet 4d3/2 and 4 ds/2 at ca. 330 eV. But, even with a long time of accumulation, the doublet is not clearly evidenced. The spectrum is noisy and perturbed by an extra peak (ca. 330 eV). Such a peak is due to AI source pollution: there is an interference between AI and Mg due to the fact that the source consists of a double anode made of aluminium and magnesium. This peak was relatively intense and concealing peaks due to platinum, so that no definite conclusion at all could be deduced concerning the valence state of platinum. V. Labalme et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 138 (1996) 93-108 3.7. TPR measurements 101 TPR experiments were performed for the detection of ionic (oxidized) species eventually formed during aging (20 h) under the oxygen and water mixture for both reference catalyst (Pt/AI203) and high barium loaded alumina (Pt/Ba* *A1203). 100 mg of each sample have been calcined under pure argon at 200 for 1 h in order to remove adsorbed water. Then, the solid was cooled down to room temperature and a reducing mixture containing hydrogen (1 vol.-%) in argon was contacted with the solid at a flow of 1.2 1/h. Temperature was raised at 10/min up to 800. Gaseous mixture was carefully dehydrated (by molecular sieves) and deoxygenated (by Deoxo prior to use. Before raising the temperature, the catalyst was submitted at 25 to the H2-Ar mixture and adsorbed oxygen titrated by hydrogen. Consumption was monitored by using a catharometer detector. For the reference catalyst aged for 20 h, no hydrogen consumption was detected at room temperature or during the temperature raising, suggesting that only metallic platinum with a very small dispersion is present. For the other solid, the TPR profile shows no consumption at room tempera- ture. At higher temperature, hydrogen consumption occurs leading to a slight broad peak between 500 and 800. Such a temperature range seems unlikely for the reduction of ionic platinum species because the later are readily reduced by hydrogen at nearly room temperature. Bulk oxide on the other hand is not very stable and decomposes at roughly 350400 even in oxygen atmosphere. Thus, if some platinum oxide was present no reduction at 5000C should have been experienced. Calculations made on total hydrogen consumption reveals that it should correspond to the total reduction of Pt in oxidation state + 4 which is highly unlikely. Thus, this hydrogen consumption is supposed to correspond to the reduction of carbonates groups evidenced by X-ray measurements.

Such a decrease cannot compensate the loss of active sites due to the sintering of metal particles. The most interesting result, in the case of Ba-loaded catalysts, is that the aged catalysts are always more active than the fresh one. This is especially evident for the low barium-loaded catalyst Pt/Ba*A1203: the longer the duration of ageing the more active the catalyst (Fig. 5). For catalyst Pt/Ba* *A1203 (Fig. 6), there is an inversion in the conversion curves corresponding to 5 and 20 h, but the 20 h aged catalyst is still more active than the fresh one. Whatever the catalyst, the apparent activation energies are always lower after ageing, suggesting either a modification in the nature of the active sites or some change in the elementary steps. Finally, when comparing the most active catalyst (20 h aged Pt/Ba*A1203) and the less active one (20 h aged Pt/AI203), there is a shift of about 200 in /'50 temperature. Comparison is more worthwhile when examining the performances at the same temperature, i.e., 250: one is almost not active (conversion of about 1%) whereas the other is very active (approximately 90% conversion). 4. Discussion The effect of barium upon the ageing behaviour of supported platinum catalysts is particularly unexpected: the Ba-containing catalysts are more active after ageing than in the fresh state. This is in opposition to the usual behaviour of catalysts which are usually less active when aged. 104 V. Labalme et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 138 (1996) 93-108 4.1. Reference catalyst Ageing has a dramatic effect on the Pt/AI203 catalyst, both on the support and on the metal. It is well known that transition aluminas are metastable structures which transform into the s-form at high temperature [7,8]. This is particularly evidenced here after 5 or 20 h ageing, where the only alumina phase being detected by X-ray diffraction is the low specific area a-A1203 (Fig. 1A). According to previous studies, water is a particularly efficient sintering agent for alumina [8,9]. At this high temperature (1200), the phase transformation kinetics is very quick, allowing within 5 h the complete transformation of all amorphous transition alumina into corundum. Results of XRD analysis are in accordance with the BET area measurements. For the fresh catalyst, only small and wide diffraction lines attributed to 6-A1203 could be observed, most part of the alumina being amorphous. After ageing, the diffraction lines assigned to c~-AI203 are very sharp, due to excellent crystallinity. The small platinum particles are not stable onto pure alumina at high temperature and also tend to sinter. This is evidenced by the very low platinum accessible areas deduced from H2/O2 titrations. T.E.M. analysis of catalyst Pt/A120~ confirms the presence of large Pt particles. The diameters ranging from 80 to 120 nm correspond to dispersions of 1.2% to 0.8%, which are in accordance with the dispersion deduced from titration measurements (0.63%). The ageing of Pt/A1203 leads to a deactivation of the catalysts in the reaction of butane combustion. However, the 5 h aged solid is surprisingly not much deactivated, in comparison with the fresh sample (/'50 is increased by only 20), whereas after 20 h a severe loss of performance is observed: Ts0 is now shifted by + 179. The specific areas of the two aged solids being similar (6 and 5 m2/g), this suggests that the dispersion of the metallic phase on the support is not in direct relation with the support area. Comparison of activities of fresh and 5 h aged catalysts at low conversion indicates that they are in a ratio of 5-10 in favour of the fresh catalyst. Ratio of the BET areas is about 15 (100/6) whereas chemisorption leads to a ratio of 70 in dispersion. These three values are not in accordance and activity is not in relation with dispersion which suggests that catalytic combustion of butane is a structure sensitive reaction, the turn-over number depending on the particles size. Propane oxidation over Pt/T-A1203 has been shown to be a structure sensitive reaction [10,11], since, a change in the turn-over frequency with the Pt particle size was observed. The propane oxidation rate was shown to increase substantially with particle size. Nevertheless, excessive sintering at temperatures higher than 900 was detrimental to the reactivity, as the surface metallic fraction becomes too small. When ageing has been performed for 20 h, deactivation is much more severe. It may be supposed that an extra sintering of metal occurs. It may be supposed V. Labalme et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 138 (1996) 93-108 105 that further sintering cannot compensate the change in active surface atoms of platinum as evidenced in the propane oxidation [10,11]. 4.2. Barium-loaded catalysts XRD study of the low Ba-containing catalyst Pt/Ba*A1203 shows clearly that no c~-A1203 has been formed after 5 h ageing, confirming that barium has a strong beneficial effect upon alumina stabilization. Apart from the diffraction lines corresponding to platinum, which are as intense as for Pt/A1203 aged in the same conditions, the only phase detected without ambiguity is barium aluminate BaA1204. Stabilisation of alumina in the presence of Ba can be attributed to the reaction of alumina superficial OH groups with barium oxide or barium hydroxide. On pure alumina, hydroxyl groups are condensed at high temperature into water leading to a A1-O-AI bridge. Some of this groups have been hypothesized as mobile species (AIOH) responsible for sintering [2,12,13]. When the surface is covered by BaO, these mobile species have been elimi- nated. Moreover, barium aluminate is able to further react with alumina in order to form a barium hexaaluminate phase. Thus, the transformation sequence should be the following: (i) reaction of superficial BaO with alumina surface leading to BaO- AI203, that is, barium aluminate, which may be only superficial, (ii) reaction of BaO, AI203 with alumina in excess leading to barium hexaaluminate [4], according to the phase diagram [14]. Such a sequence is in accordance with the XRD data. If the BaO concentra- tion is low, formation of BaAlzO4 occurs first within 5 h. But if ageing has been performed for 20 h only, hexaaluminate is observed. Solid state transformations have their own kinetics depending upon the relative concentrations of solids. A duration of 5 h is not sufficient to transform barium oxide into hexaaluminate, whereas transformation is complete within 20 h. For the high Ba loaded solid, BaA1204 phase is observed with a higher concentration as revealed by the XRD patterns. But, due to the barium content, the formation of barium hexaaluminate cannot occur completely within the same time: this must require a longer duration. The traces of barium carbonate always observed after a 5 h treatment are also indicative of incomplete reaction. All XRD experiments have been performed in open air, so, carbonation of BaO although slow cannot be avoided. This reveals also that parts of BaO which is superficial have not migrated inside the alumina network. At last, the surface areas are in accordance with the transformation of alumina into aluminates, that are thermostable and sintering resistant [15]. Despite the good thermal behaviour of the Ba-loaded support, the dispersion of platinum is very low. In the first part of this work, devoted to fresh catalysts [1], we reported that introduction of barium lowers the metallic accessible fraction from 40% for Pt/A1203 to 13% for Pt/Ba*A1203 and Pt/Ba* *A1203. 106 V. Labalme et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 138 (1996) 93-108 After ageing, the dispersions are almost nil and are similar to that corresponding to aged Pt/AI203 free of barium. Support stabilization is effective when using barium because of the formation of new thermostable phases. But these latter are inefficient for maintaining metal dispersion to a measurable level. Thus, at first sight, sintering of metal is independent of that of support which can be well dispersed or not (Table 1). Surprisingly, the activity of aged Pt/Ba-AI203 catalysts is much higher than for Pt/A1203. One first and partial conclusion is that catalytic activity in total combustion cannot be directly connected with the metal dispersion: in other words, metal particles should not be considered by themselves as the active phase. This hypothesis has to be demonstrated more firmly. This is the following and final part of the discussion. 4.3. Nature of the active phase The drastic sintering of platinum particles which is similar for the three catalysts suggests that other species than surface metal atoms have to be considered as active in the catalytic combustion of n-butane for Ba-promoted solids: (i) species containing platinum in oxidized state, (ii) participation of oxygen species arising from the support. Activity may be due to the presence of dispersed platinum oxides (PtO, PtO2) which can be formed during the ageing procedure in the presence of small amounts of oxygen as a transition state in the reaction. This hypothesis is unlikely. The catalysts were reduced before any measurement of the catalytic activity. During butane oxidation reaction, oxygen, which is present in excess, may oxidise platinum leading to PtOx. But in that case the same would be true for alumina also, what is experimentally not observed. Moreover, platinum is known to be rather insensitive towards oxygen whatever the temperature. At least both TPR and IRTF should have revealed the presence of oxidized species, leading to hydrogen consumption on one hand and to a high frequency of CO adsorbed on the other hand. Neither TPR nor FTIR have revealed any oxidized platinum species. The BaPtO3 perovskite, where platinum is present as Pt4ions is known as one of the most active perovskite in catalytic combustion of hydrocarbons [16]. The formation of this phase requires (i) oxidation of Pt into Pt4+, (ii) reaction with BaO. Such a solid state reaction cannot occur at low temperature and requires long calcination time at elevated temperature as is usually needed for perovskite synthesis via a ceramic method. The formation of a perovskite phase seems unlikely as PtO2 is not stable and decomposes at 500: at higher temperature only the metallic phase is stable. Moreover, if it was formed, FTIR experiments (CO adsorption should have given a high frequency stretching band) and by TPR measurements (some hydrogen consumption should have been recorded) should have evidenced the presence of this phase. V. Labalme et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 138 (1996) 93-108 107 One other proposal could be the incorporation of some platinum ions into the hexaaluminate lattice. This is also unlikely. Firstly, only Pt2may eventually be incorporated as does every extra ion in such structure [17] (no M4+ species have been never evidenced in hexaaluminate structure). Secondly, divalent platinum ions are too big to enter the aluminate for which ion radius is limited in the spinel block structure [18]. Thirdly, sites accepting extra cations are of tetrahe- dral and octahedral symmetries. Both are not regular for Pt2+ cations whose complexes are almost exclusively square planar [19]. Incorporation of platinum seems impossible as it should also require a solid state reaction at high temperature, at which platinum is in the metallic state. Obviously, the main difference between Pt/A1203 and Pt/Ba-A1203 is the presence of BaO, which is a strongly basic oxide. The catalytic properties of basic oxides have been evidenced in the case of oxidative coupling of methane [20]. At high temperature and in the presence of oxygen, alkaline and alkaline- earth ions may form peroxides. As a matter of fact, the crystal structure of CaO2, BaO2 and SrO2 contains 022- ions [21]. Formation of such surface species may be favoured by the presence of noble metal which is able to dissociate the oxygen molecule. In such a case, the formation of Pts-O species occurs whatever the dispersion of the metallic phase. 5. Conclusion For high temperature catalytic combustion, noble metal are usually not stable because they sinter as well as the support leading to inactive solids. This has been experienced here. Alumina supporting 2.5% in weight of platinum does not resist to ageing at 1200 in the presence of steam. Transformation into a-form occurs within a few hours and metallic phase sinters tremendously. When the support is modified by barium addition (surface doping) the formation of a AI203 is fully inhibited. Barium aluminate is formed first by solid-state reaction with alumina, then barium hexaaluminate after longer time of ageing. In any case, the support resists to sintering, keeping high surface areas. As far as platinum is concerned, such a conclusion is not valid. Irrespective of the barium loading, platinum sinters into large crystallites leading to a dispersion which is hardly measurable. Despite this drastic sintering a much more active catalyst is obtained after ageing which is in total opposition with dispersion. Platinum surface atoms cannot be considered as the only active phase. Several hypothesises have been done on the nature of the species responsible for the high catalytic activity after ageing. Characterization of such species will need the use of more sensitive methods to study these unusual catalysts. 108 V.

Tel. (+33) 72448333, fax. (+33) 78941995. Resistance of platinum deposited onto alumina and barium modified alumina, towards ageing at 1200°C has been studied experimentally in the catalytic combustion of butane. With pure alumina, ageing has a tremendous effect on both the surface area of the support and metal dispersion which induces severe loss of activity. High temperature calcination of PtBa/Al2O3 samples leads to a solid state reaction leading first to BaO · Al2O3, then to BaO · 6Al2O3. The latter phase is strongly heat resistant inhibiting α-Al2O3 transformation. Despite surface area preservation, platinum is not stabilised on this support: metallic dispersion is very low, as evidenced by the formation of very large particles. Unexpectedly, activity is enhanced on such sintered catalyst. Some hypothesis concerning active species have been proposed to explain this activity enhancement. It is suggested that some kind of mobile superficial oxygen atom may be responsible for the activity.
