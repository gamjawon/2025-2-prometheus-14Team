Surface area, surface acidity, and morphology of the catalysts have been analysed and correlated with their catalytic activity. The isolated yields of 2-substituted benzimidazoles and 1,5-disubstituted benzodi- azepines are in the range of 30% to 95%. A good correlation between the amount of surface acid sites as well as the surface morphology of the catalysts and the catalytic activity has been observed. This method has been found to be simple and economical. The solid supports could be regenerated and reused without much loss in their activity. Further, the solid supports have been also found to be effective as general catalysts in the condensation of o-phenylenediamine with other substituted aldehydes and ketones. Key words: 2-substituted benzimidazoles; 1,5-disubstituted benzodiazepines; manganese oxide; alumina; zirconia For several decades there has been a concern for improving the chemical processes in industry, with regard to environ- mental and health related issues, which would also eventually reduce chemical waste. Catalytic activation of substrates under heterogeneous conditions using solid acids and bases [1,2] as catalysts or catalyst supports has been identified as one of the important ways to make the given process environmentally benign and efficient. Thus over the years a lot of research has been focused on the development of greener processes [3]. Benzimidazole derivates exhibit various biological and phar- maceutical properties [4â€“7]. Recently it has been found that benzimidazole derivatives are useful as fluorescent chemo- sensors for Cu 2+ [8]. Benzodiazepine and their derivates are also interesting class of bioactive compounds widely used in therapeutics [9] as anti-convulsant, analgesics, anti-anxiety drugs, sedatives, anti-depressants, and hypnotics [10â€“12]. One of the methods commonly reported by several groups for the synthesis of benzimidazoles and benzodiazepines is the con- densation reaction between o-phenylenediamine (OPDA) and an aldehyde [13â€“15] or a ketone [16â€“19], respectively. Catalytic activities of different Lewis acids have been in- vestigated in the synthesis of benzimidazoles and benzodi- azepines by different groups highlighting the advantages of their protocol over the other methods. However, to the best of our knowledge no attempt has been made to correlate the sur- face properties of the catalysts and their catalytic activity in the condensation of aldehydes/ketones with OPDA to synthesise benzimidazoles and benzodiazepines. Metal oxides and supported metal oxides are known to possess surface acidity and/or basicity and activate a number of industrially important organic transformations [20,21]. Ac- cordingly the present investigation focuses on the preparation, M. REKHA et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 439â€“446 characterization, and catalytic applications of Al 2 O 3 , ZrO 2 , Manganese oxide/Al 2 O 3 and Manganese oxide/ZrO 2 . A corre- lation between the amount of surface acid sites, surface mor- phology, and the catalytic activity is described. 1 Experimental 1.1 Preparation of the catalyst Catalysts containing 5% of manganese oxide on Al 2 O 3 and ZrO 2 were prepared by precipitation method. A calculated quantity of manganese sulphate was dissolved in 500 ml of distilled water. To this solution, a required amount of Al(OH) 3 or Zr(OH) 4 powder was added in small portions while the solution was being stirred (molar ratio of Mn:Al = 0.05:0.95). The mixture was heated to 80 o C and 28% NH 3 solution was added drop-wise to precipitate manganese as its hydroxide (pH = 9). A thick brown precipitate thus obtained was digested for 4 h on a water bath, separated by filtration, washed with distilled water, and dried in a hot air oven at 120 o C for 12 h and then calcined in a furnace at 450 o C for 5 h. Al 2 O 3 and ZrO 2 catalysts without manganese oxide were obtained by drying the com- mercial Al(OH) 3 or Zr(OH) 4 at 120 o C followed by calcination at 450 o C for 5 h. These catalysts are denoted as Al 2 O 3 -120, MnAl 2 O 3 -120, Al 2 O 3 -450, MnAl 2 O 3 -120, ZrO 2 -120, MnZrO 2 -120, ZrO 2 -450, and MnZrO 2 -450. 1.2 Characterization of the catalyst BET surface area of the catalysts was determined from N 2 adsorption data acquired on a Micromeritics TriStar 3000 instrument. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Panalytical Xpert pro X-ray diffractometer using Cu K radiation ( = 0.154 nm) in the 2 range of 5 o â€“70 o at 40 kV and at a scanning rate of 2 o /min. The amounts of surface acid sites of the catalysts were determined by N-butylamine titration method. The surface morphology of the materials were studied by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) using JEOL JSM-7500F microscope operating at 20 kV at a working distance of 8 mm. The particle size and dis- tribution of the materials were studied by low resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a TECNAI 10 PHILIPS microscope. Prior to the analysis, the samples were dispersed in ethanol and a drop of the suspension was deposited on a holey carbon-coated copper grid. 1.3 Characterization of the reaction product Infrared spectra of the products were recorded from a Nicolet Model Impact 400D FT-IR spectrometer with 4 cm â€“1 resolution. Sample pellets were made by pressing a mixture of the sample with KBr in the required ratio. The mass spectra of the filtrate were recorded on GC-MS Shimadzu QP 5000, GC-17A. 1 H NMR spectrum was obtained in DMSO solution at 300 MHz using Bruker Avance NMR spectrometers. Spec- trum is referenced to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). 1.4 Catalytic activity study Catalytic activity of the catalysts, dried at 120 o C and cal- cined at 450 o C, was investigated in the condensation reaction between OPDA and benzaldehyde or acetophenone (Scheme 1). This is used as a model reaction. In a typical procedure a mixture of OPDA (1 mmol), benzaldehyde (1 mmol) or ace- tophenone (2.2 mmol), ethanol (5 ml), and the catalyst (0.2 g) taken in a 100 ml RB flask was heated to 80 o C. The progress of the reaction was monitored periodically by analysing the reac- tion mixture by thin layer chromatography using a mixture of petroleum ether and ethyl acetate in 8:2 ratio. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was diluted with 10 ml of ethanol and filtered to recover the solid catalyst. The filtrate was poured into a beaker containing crushed ice. The solid product was separated and purified by column chromatography using silica gel [100â€“200 mesh] with petroleum ether and ethyl acetate as solvent. The products were further analyzed by IR, 1 H NMR, and GC-MS techniques. + Acetophenone Ethanol, 80 o C NH 2 NH 2 + O H C 6 H 5 Ethanol, 80 o C N N H C 6 H 5 Benzaldehyde O H 5 C 6 CH 3 NH 2 NH 2 o-phenylenediamine o-phenylenediamine 0.2 g catalyst N H N CH 3 C 6 H 5 C 6 H 5 0.2 g catalyst 2-methyl-2,4-diphenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-1,5-benzodiazepine 2-phenyl-1H-benzimidazole Scheme 1.

REKHA et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 439â€“446 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Catalyst characterization 2.1.1 BET surface area and acidity The quantitative data on the BET surface area and amount of surface acid sites of the catalysts are given in the Table 1. The surface acidities of alumina catalysts followed the order of MnAl 2 O 3 -450 > Al 2 O 3 -450 > MnAl 2 O 3 -120 > Al 2 O 3 -120. And for the zirconia catalyst, the surface acidities are MnZrO 2 -450 > MnZrO 2 -120 > ZrO 2 -450 > ZrO 2 -120. From the above alumina and zirconia catalysts, MnZrO 2 -450 catalyst showed a higher amount of surface acid sites. The surface area of alumina catalysts followed the order of Al 2 O 3 -450 > MnAl 2 O 3 -450 > MnAl 2 O 3 -120 > Al 2 O 3 -120. And for the zirconia catalyst, the surface area are ZrO 2 -120 > MnZrO 2 -120 > MnZrO 2 -450 > ZrO 2 -450. Surface acidity of alumina cata- lysts is less than that of zirconia catalysts. Calcination in- creased the surface acidity more in the case of zirconia than alumina catalysts. MnZrO 2 -450 catalyst showed the highest surface acidity of all the catalysts. On calcination the surface area of alumina catalysts increased significantly whereas it decreased in the case of zirconia catalysts. MnAl 2 O 3 -450 catalyst showed the highest surface area. 2.1.2 XRD results XRD patterns of the catalysts are shown in Fig. 1. It is ob- served that on calcinations, crystalline nature of alumina catalysts decreased whereas zirconia sample becomes more crystalline. This observation clearly accounts for the variation in the surface area of the respective samples upon calcination as discussed previously. The highly crystalline XRD pattern of uncalcined Al 2 O 3 corresponds to the gibbsite phase [22], however the crystallinity of the catalyst decreased on calcina- tion with the formation of boehmite phase [23] (Fig. 1(a)). When manganese oxide is deposited on alumina, the charac- teristic Hausmannite, Mn 3 O 4 phase along with the Boehmite phase of alumina was observed which is not observed in MnAl 2 O 3 -120 catalyst. The XRD patterns of ZrO 2 -120 and MnZrO 2 -120 shows no distinct peaks indicating the amorphous nature of the catalysts (Fig. 1(b)). On calcination the crystal- linity of both the catalysts has increased. In the case of ZrO 2 -450, majority of the ZrO 2 is crystallized into tetragonal phase [24] with small amount of monoclinic phase [25]. However pure tetragonal phase of ZrO 2 is formed in the case of MnZrO 2 -450 due to phase transition of stable monoclinic to tetragonal phase transfer is observed on manganese oxide deposition and calcinations at 450 o C. It is also noteworthy that upon deposition of manganese oxide on zirconia and calcined Table 1 BET surface area, amount of surface acid sites in alumina and zirconia catalysts, and their activity in the synthesis of benzimidazole and benzo- diazepines Isolated yield (%) Catalyst Specific surface area (m 2 /g) Surface acidity (mmol/g) Benzimidazole Benzodiazepine Al 2 O 3 -120 1.38 0.75 30 30 MnAl 2 O 3 -120 3.13 1.00 67 60 Al 2 O 3 -450 262.81 1.01 52 35 MnAl 2 O 3 -450 209.67 1.25 90 85 ZrO 2 -120 174.26 0.50 34 47 MnZrO 2 -120 154.90 1.50 70 74 ZrO 2 -450 61.39 1.25 65 70 MnZrO 2 -450 92.37 2.25 95 93 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Al 2 O 3 -450 MnAl 2 O 3 -120 MnAl 2 O 3 -450 I n t e n s i t y 2 ( o ) Al 2 O 3 -120 (a) MnZrO 2 -450 MnZrO 2 -120 ZrO 2 -450 I n t e n s i t y ZrO 2 -120 (b) Fig. 1.

REKHA et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 439â€“446 at 450 o C, no diffraction peaks corresponding to any manga- nese oxide phases have appeared and catalytically active tetragonal phase is stabilised. 2.1.3 SEM and TEM image SEM and TEM images of a few representative catalysts are shown in the Fig. 2. It is interesting to note that the morphology of the alumina catalysts is distinctly different from those of zirconia catalysts. Samples of zirconia exhibited tubular/needle like shapes with a thickness approximately 30 nm, decorated with manganese oxide particles. 2.2 Catalytic activity study The percentage yields of the isolated product in the con- densation reaction between OPDA and benzalde- hyde/acetophenone conducted in the presence of solid supports are given in the Table 1. It is to be noted that the OPDA con- version in the absence of a solid support was low. However, in the presence of Al 2 O 3 , ZrO 2 , manganese oxide/Al 2 O 3 , and manganese oxide/ZrO 2 catalysts improved the yields. The yield of the isolated product was in the range 30% to 95%. Pure Alumina was found to be less active than pure zirconia. MnZrO 2 -450 catalyst showed highest catalytic activity than other samples (alumina and zirconia based samples). It is in- teresting to note that a good correlation between the amount of the acid site and the catalytic activity is observed. Thus, it may be inferred that the condensation reaction between OPDA and an aldehyde/ketone is activated by the surface acidity of the solid catalysts. Further, taking into account of the variation of other textural properties of the catalyst on calcinations and incorporation of manganese oxide, it is worthwhile to mention here that synergistic effects of the following parameters con- tribute to the overall increase in the catalytic activity of the solid catalysts: (1) enhancement of the intrinsic surface acid sites concentration of the supports on calcination; (2) contri- bution to the additional acidity by the presence of manganese oxide on alumina and zirconia; (3) stabilisation of catalytically active tetragonal phase of zirconia on calcination in the pres- ence of manganese oxide. It may be noted here that the boehmite phase of alumina and tetragonal phase of zirconia that are formed upon calcination are catalytically active for this condensation reaction. It is evident from the results presented in Table 1, that 5%MnZrO 2 -450 showed the best results in terms of OPDA conversion. In order to evaluate the effects of the solvent, reaction temperature, and amount of catalyst on the product (a) (b) (c) (d) Fig. 2. SEM images of MnAl 2 O 3 -450 (a) and MnZrO 2 -450 (b) catalysts and TEM images of MnAl 2 O 3 -450 (c) and MnZrO 2 -450 (d) catalysts. M. REKHA et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2012, 33: 439â€“446 yield, the following optimisation reactions were conducted using this catalyst. 2.2.1 Effect of solvent The isolated yields of the reaction products in the presence of different solvents are shown in Fig. 3. The yield was high even in the absence of any solvent but only at high tempera- tures. The high boiling solvents DMSO and DMF not only resulted in lower yield but also presented handling problems. Further, isolation of the products was found to be tedious when water was used as the solvent. Methanol was not preferred as it is not safe and is not green. Acetonitrile and chloroform also resulted in lower yields. Ethanol was found to be the best sol- vent for this reaction based on its low cost, easy work-up of the reaction mixture, and good yield of the products. Hence for further studies in synthesis of substituted benzimidazoles and benzodiazepines ethanol is used as a solvent. 2.2.2 Effect of reaction temperature The results of the experiments conducted at different tem- peratures are shown in Fig. 4. When the reaction was con- ducted at room temperature the yield was only 25% to 30%. However the conversion of OPDA was found to increase with good selectivity with an increase in the temperature up to 80 o C, above which the conversion of OPDA remained constant while the selectivity towards the expected product also decreased. 2.2.3 Amount and reusability of the catalyst The condensation reactions were conducted using ethanol as the solvent at 80 o C and different amounts of 5% MnZrO 2 -450 catalyst in the range 0.05 to 1 g. The best yield of the reaction product was obtained with 0.2 g of the catalyst. Higher amounts of the catalyst did not improve the yield. The catalyst could be easily recovered by simple filtration of the reaction mixture, followed by washing with acetone and drying in oven at 110 o C for 2 h. Recovery of the catalytic activity of the zir- conia based catalysts was better than alumina based catalysts. Zirconia catalysts could be reused upto 5 times without any significant loss in catalyst efficiency (Table 2). 2.2.4 Generality of the catalytic activity of the catalysts The activity of our catalyst was further investigated for its general application in the condensation reaction of OPDA with other substituted aldehydes and ketones. All the reactions were conducted with 5% MnZrO 2 -450 catalyst, using ethanol as the solvent under refluxing conditions. The results in terms of the isolated yield of the expected product with various substituted aldehydes and ketones are presented in the Tables 3 and 4, respectively. It is noteworthy that an excellent yield of the expected product could be obtained with in 1â€“2 h of the reac- tion. All the isolated products were analysed by their MP, IR, GC-MS, and 1 HNMR techniques. The condensation of OPDA with aldehydes was more efficient than the ketones in terms of the duration of the reaction. Thus it may be concluded that manganese oxide supported on zirconia may be used as general catalyst to activate the condensation reaction described in this paper. The spectral data of some representative products are given below.

Manganese oxide supported on zirconia was found to be efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the synthesis of 2-substituted benzimidazoles and 1,5-disubstituted benzodi- azepines by the condensation of o-phenylenediamine with different substituted aldehydes and ketones. Mild reaction conditions, easy work up and high yields along with reusability of the catalyst make it a valuable alternative to the existing catalysts in the literature. The importance of the amount of surface acid sites and morphology of the catalysts in activating the condensation reaction between OPDA and an alde- hyde/ketone is made clear.

Tel: +91-9886765750; Fax: +91-8022245831 In this study, alumina, zirconia, manganese oxide/alumina, and manganese oxide/zirconia have been investigated for their catalytic activity in the condensation reaction between o-phenylenediamine and an aldehyde or a ketone to synthesise 2-substituted benzimidazoles and 1,5-disubstituted benzodiazepines respectively. Surface area, surface acidity, and morphology of the catalysts have been analysed and correlated with their catalytic activity. The isolated yields of 2-substituted benzimidazoles and 1,5-disubstituted benzodiazepines are in the range of 30% to 95%. A good correlation between the amount of surface acid sites as well as the surface morphology of the catalysts and the catalytic activity has been observed. This method has been found to be simple and economical. The solid supports could be regenerated and reused without much loss in their activity. Further, the solid supports have been also found to be effective as general catalysts in the condensation of o-phenylenediamine with other substituted aldehydes and ketones.
