Designing a low-cost and efficient photocatalytic system to produce high-valuable carbonates from the cycloaddition of CO2 by using clean and renewable sunlight as the driving force shows great research potential. Here, a commercially available 4,4''-diamino-p-terphenyl (DT) was directly employed to promote the photocatalytic cycloaddition of CO2 and various epoxides under visible light irradiation. As high as 95 % yield of target carbonate was obtained using blue LED (>450 nm) as a light source for 6 h under solvent-free/atmospheric CO2/room temperature conditions. Even under irradiation of natural light, a good yield of 68 % carbonate can also be achieved under ambient conditions. Moreover, in situ EPR and a series of controlled experiments were conducted to investigate the plausible photocatalytic mechanism, demonstrating that amino-containing DT with both π-π and p-π conjugated structure provides abundant basic sites and photogenerated electrons/holes as active sites for CO2 activation and ring opening of epoxides at the same time. Graphical Abstract Commercially available 4,4''-diamino-p-terphenyl was directly used as a photocatalyst to promote the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides under visible light irradiation, affording high yields of various cyclic carbonates under mild conditions. Its synergistic effect of π-π and p-π conjugation as well as the basic sites play a crucial role in photocatalytic performance.

On the other side, CO2 could be an abundant and non-toxic C1 resource for synthesizing various high-value-added chemicals, of which cyclic carbonates generated from the cycloaddition reaction of epoxides and CO2 is of great interest due to its advantages in atomic economics and green chemistry [2]. It is noteworthy that cyclic carbonates are versatile in the chemical field, such as green solvents, pharmaceutical intermediates [3], and electrolytes for lithium-ion batteries [4]. Compared to traditional thermocatalytic strategies with relatively rigorous reaction conditions, photocatalytic systems using solar energy as a clean and renewable driven force for the production of cyclic carbonates seem more attractive and cater to green chemical criteria. In recent years, the use of visible light as an energy source to drive the formation of cyclic carbonates from CO2 has attracted wide attention. For example, Wu et al. synthesized Ag/NWU-Cd3 composite materials from 2,6-bis (4′-carboxyl-phenyl) pyridine, 1,3,5-tri(1H-imidazol1-yl) benzene, and Ag NPs for photocatalytic CO2 cycloaddition, achieving a 94.3 % yield of styrene carbonate under visible light irradiation [5]. Abhinav et al. utilized Zr-thiamine complexes and urea as raw materials to prepare a heterojunction photocatalyst Zr-thiamine/g-CN via pyrolyzation process, of which the Zr-Thia(75)/g-C3N4 displayed the best catalytic efficiency and afforded a 96 % yield of the cyclic carbonate [6]. Li et al. synthesized macrocycle-on- covalent organic framework (COF) from 4, 4′,4′′,4′′′-(pyrene-1,3,6,8-tet­ rayl)tetraaniline and 2′,5′-bis(2-(2-methox­yethoxy)ethoxy)-4,4′′-dimethyl-1,1′:4′,1′′-terphenyl for photocatalytic CO2 cycloaddition reaction, obtaining a 99 % conversion of epichlorohydrin [7]. Anjan Das et al. synthesized TpPa-1 COF using the pre-synthesized 2,4,6-triformyl phloroglucinol and p-phenylenediamine as raw materials as a photocatalyst, obtaining an 86 % yield of the styrene carbonate under LED (Light Emitting Diode) light irradiation (455 nm) [8]. Although these reported photocatalytic systems have shown excellent performance for visible-light triggered production of cyclic carbonates from the cycloaddition reaction of CO2 and epoxides, most of them require costly raw materials or fussy synthesis procedures that are not conducive to industrialization. Accordingly, Sandhya et al. introduced commercially available anthraquinone (AQ) as a metal-free photocatalyst for the cycloaddition reaction of CO2, allowing an as high as 98 % yield of cyclic carbonate in the presence of acetonitrile as solvent under visible light irradiation for 12 h [9]. However, the use of acetonitrile as a solvent for a relatively long time not only increases the cost of energy but also brings some environmental pollution risks due to a more cumbersome product separation process. Thus, developing a more sustainable and energy-saving photocatalytic system is quite desired for the conversion of CO2 into valuable cyclic carbonates. Inspired by the above discussion, we here exploit a low-cost, metal-free, and solvent-free photocatalytic system by introducing commercially available 4,4''-diamino-p-terphenyl (DT) as a catalyst for the CO2 cycloaddition reaction, endowing more than 13 cyclic carbonates with moderate to excellent yields under blue-LED light (λ>450 nm) irradiation and room temperature. The corresponding reaction mechanism was carefully investigated in combination with a series of control and in situ experiments, demonstrating that amino-containing DT with both π-π and p-π conjugated structure provides abundant basic sites and photogenerated electrons/holes as active sites for CO2 activation and ring opening of epoxides at the same time. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Materials 4,4''-Diamino-p-terphenyl (98 %), epichlorohydrin (99 %), glycidol (99 %) and styreneoxide (98 %) were purchased from Innochem Co., Ltd. Tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) (99 %), 2-methylphenyl glycidy ether (90 %), tert-butyl glycidyl ether (99 %), p-terphenyl (99 %)，butyl glycidyl ether (98 %),1,2-epoxyoctane(99 %) and allyl glycidyl ether (99 %) were purchased from Macklin Co., Ltd. Epibromohydrin (98 %), 2-phenoxy-ethyl (99 %) and [(phenylmethoxy)methyl]oxirane (97 %) were obtained from Aladdin Co., Ltd. All chemicals were used without further purification. 2.2 Evaluation of catalytic performance for the production of cyclic carbonates The cycloaddition reactions were carried out in a Schlenk tube with a magnetic stirrer. In a typical procedure, 0.7 mol% 4,4''-diamino-p-terphenyl (DT) photocatalyst and 2.5 mol% TBAB were added to the photoreaction tube first, then the tube was vacuumed. Subsequently, 5 mmol epichlorohydrin and 1 bar CO2 were added into the above tube, and put it in the photoreactor to react under specific reaction conditions (Fig.S1). All tests were carried out at 25 ℃ controlled by the cooling cycle system. After the reaction finished, the reaction mixture was diluted with ethanol to quantify the yield of the corresponding cyclic carbonate via gas chromatography (GC). At the same time, the used DT could be recrystallized, which was further isolated via centrifugation, washed 3 times with ethanol, and dried at 60 °C for the next recycle. 2.3 Photoelectric chemistry experiment Photocurrent response density and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were conducted using an electrochemical workstation (LK5600, China) with a three-electrode system under a 300 W Xe lamp light irradiation. In detail, a 5 mg sample was dissolved in 500 µL tetrahydrofuran containing 20 µL Nafion solution. The above solution was stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature. Then, 10 µL of the above solvent was spread on the 3 mm diameter hole on an ITO (indium tin oxide) glass plate. Normal photocurrent response density was tested by using the above ITO plate as a working electrode, Ag/AgCl (in saturated KCl) as a reference electrode, platinum (Pt) wire acted as a counter electrode, and 0.2 mol/L Na2SO4 as the electrolyte solution. The controlled photocurrent response density experiments were conducted with the same electrode system using an acetonitrile solution containing tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M) as electrolyte solution in the absence and presence of epichlorohydrin and CO2, respectively. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was obtained by using the same three-electrode system in a 50 mL electrolyte solution prepared from K3[Fe(CN)6], K4[Fe(CN)6], and KCl. All electrochemical experiments were conducted at a voltage of 0 V (vs Ag/AgCl). Cyclic voltammetry experiments were conducted using a calomel electrode as the reference electrode, a Pt wire as the counter electrode, and an ITO plate as the working electrode in an acetonitrile solution containing 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate and 0.02 M epichlorohydrin under different atmospheric conditions (N2/CO2). 2.4 Characterization technique The valence band XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) was obtained from Thermo Fisher 250XI, USA. The UV-Vis DRS (UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectra) were measured on Shimadzu UV-2700 with integrating sphere and BaSO4 reflection standard reference. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were conducted on Shimadzu RF-6000 under 370 nm excitation at room temperature. EPR (Electron Paramagnetic Resonance) experiments were conducted on BRUKE EMXPLUS. The light reaction instrument is the parallel light reaction instrument (SSSTECH-AF3). The yield of the product was detected by gas chromatography (SHIMADZU GC-2014C). The infrared spectra were carried out on a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer (SHIMADZU IRAffinity-1S). Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) was performed with a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer (JEOLJNM-ECZ400s). 2.5 Photocatalytic CO2 cycloaddition reaction under natural sunlight illumination The photocatalytic CO2 cycloaddition reaction was conducted under natural sunlight illumination at Guiyang located in the southwest of China (in summer). In detail, 5 mmol epichlorohydrin, 0.7 mol% DT, 2.5 mol% TBAB, and 1 bar CO2 were added to the reaction tube, which was put in natural conditions under stirring for 16 h. After finishing the reaction, the DT solid was recrystallized by adding ethanol to the reaction mixture, and the corresponding cyclic carbonate was obtained by rotational evaporation. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 CO2 cycloaddition catalyzed over DT DT was employed as a metal-free catalyst in combination with tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) as a cocatalyst to investigate the photocatalytic performance of the cycloaddition reaction of atmospheric CO2 with epoxides under solvent-free and room-temperature conditions (25 ºC). Initially, epichlorohydrin was selected as a model substrate to study the effect of various reaction parameters on photocatalytic efficiency. As shown in Fig. 1, light wavelength, light intensity, reaction time, and catalyst dosage were surveyed in detail. Firstly, the photocatalytic cycloaddition of epichlorohydrin and CO2 was performed under LED visible light irradiation with different light wavelengths (Fig. 1a). Excellent yields of cyclic carbonate can be obtained in a range of 410–485 nm of light wavelength, while further declined the value of light wavelength to 500 nm results in an obvious decrease in photocatalytic activity with a 64 % yield of target carbonate. The intensity of light could also influence the photocatalytic yield of cyclic carbonate (Fig. 1b). Undoubtedly, there is a higher yield of target carbonate using a stronger intensity light irradiation within the same reaction time, owing to the increased photogenerated electrons and holes with the increase of light intensity. In addition, the yield of cyclic carbonate enhanced with the extension of reaction time under the same light-intensity irradiation. Using 6 W and 8 W intensity light afforded satisfactory yields (>95 %) within only 6 h. From the point of view of energy saving, 6 W and 6 h were employed for the following study. Furthermore, the dosage of co-catalyst TBAB could also affect the photocatalytic efficiency (Fig. 1c). A low dosage of TBAB (0.6 mol%) afforded a lower yield of cyclic carbonate (63 %), while a remarkable yield of up to 95 % was obtained with a slightly increased dosage (2.5 mol%). We also investigate the influence of catalyst dosage on the photocatalytic cycloaddition reaction of CO2 (Fig. 1d). There is a slight cyclic carbonate formed in the absence of photocatalyst DT. It was found an excellent carbonate yield of 95 % could obtained by using as low as 0.7 mol% photocatalyst with a relatively high TOF (turnover frequency) value of 22.4 h−1. Further increasing the catalyst dosage to 2.1 mol% gives a constant catalytic efficiency, but a higher dosage of 2.8 mol% results in a decrease in cyclic carbonate yield due to the restricted mass transfer efficiency. Accordingly, under such mildly optimized reaction conditions of blue LED light irradiation (λ>450 nm), 0.7 mol% DT, 2.5 mol% TBAB, and room temperature (25 ºC) for 6 h with 6 W light intensity allowed a high yield of carbonate up to 95 %. It shows obvious advantages in higher photocatalytic efficiency within a short reaction time and the use of lower amounts of photocatalyst compared to most previous works (Table S2). Additionally, the substrate scope was investigated under the optimized reaction conditions. As shown in Table 1, most tested epoxides display excellent activity with more than 90 % yields of corresponding cyclic carbonates. In detail, the epoxides with halogen groups such as chloro- and bromo- (2a & 2b) show high activity with 95 % yields of target carbonates within 6 h. However, the epoxides with alkyl group (2d & 2e) allowed low yields of the corresponding carbonate. For glycidyl ethers, methyl glycidyl ether (2 f) with 80 % yield of target carbonate exhibits better activity than butyl (2 g) and tert-butyl glycidyl ethers (2 h). Moreover, the epoxides containing allyl (2i) and benzene ring with up to 96 % yield display higher performance than alkyl glycidyl ethers. These results demonstrated that the provided photocatalytic system using small molecule DT as a catalyst has general applicability. Furthermore, using epichlorohydrin as the substrate under optimal conditions, the recycling experiment was conducted to evaluate the stability of DT (Fig S2a). It is obvious that the catalyst DT maintained its photocatalytic activity without a significant decrease in yield after five consecutive cycles. The stability of DT was further investigated via FT-IR and NMR spectrum. It was found that there are no obvious changes in the characteristic peaks of DT after recycling (Fig. S2b), of which a new peak at 1783 cm⁻¹ on the spectrum of the reused catalyst belongs to the CO stretching vibrations of the residual carbonate product. Moreover, from the ¹ ³C NMR spectrum of fresh and reused DT (Fig. S2c), its structure is almost unchanged after the photocatalytic process. These results indicate that DT with good stability can be recycled 5 times at least without loss of catalytic activity. 3.2 Photoelectronic tests of DT and P-terphenyl Considering DT containing amino groups and terphenyl conjugated structure, a series of photoelectronic tests were conducted to figure out the relationship between its structure and excellent photocatalytic performance. The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV–vis DRS) were conducted to study the optical absorption properties of DT and p-terphenyl. Fig. 2a shows the absorption edge of DT located at 600 nm, while p-terphenyl has the corresponding absorption edge at 400 nm. The presence of amino groups results in an obvious redshift, likely because the lone pair of electrons on the N atom could conjugate with the π-bond of the benzene ring. Furthermore, the Tauc plot(Fig. 2b) curve indicates DT with a lower optical band gap energy than p-terphenyl, attributing to DT with an additional p-π conjugation structure that could increase the efficiency of electron migration [10]. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements (Fig. 2c) show that the peak intensity of DT is lower than p-terphenyl, indicating that DT has better separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers. The photocurrent density and charge carriers' transport ability were measured by using transient photocurrent response and electrochemistry impedance. From Fig. 2d, DT exhibits a cathodic photocurrent with −2.3 μA·cm−2 current intensity, indicating that it is a p-type semiconductor [11]. In contrast, p-terphenyl shows a very weak photocurrent under the same condition. This suggested that the amino group on DT can promote the separation efficiency of photoinduced electron-hole pairs. There is a smaller impedance arc radius using DT as an electrode material (Fig. 2e), further illustrating that it has a higher carrier separation and migration efficiency [12]. Furthermore, p-terphenyl was also utilized as an alternative catalyst for the photocatalytic CO2 cycloaddition under the optimal reaction conditions, affording only 17 % yield of target cyclic carbonate (Table S1). According to the above results, the coexistence of π-π and p-π conjugated structure induced by the amino groups favors the migration of charge carriers, thus allowing better photocatalytic performance. 3.3 Possible mechanism of the reaction To further explore how photogenerated electrons and holes work in photocatalysis, p-benzoquinone and ammonium oxalate were used as electron and hole quenchers, respectively. A yield of 95 % target carbonate was obtained without any quencher, which distinctly decreased with the addition of both p-benzoquinone (65 %) and ammonium oxalate (77 %). It preliminarily indicates that the photogenerated holes/electrons could influence catalytic efficiency. Then, p-benzoquinone and ammonium oxalate were added to the photoreaction system simultaneously, resulting in a relatively low yield of carbonate product (35 %). This result further illustrated the synergistic effect of photogenerated electrons and holes on catalytic performance. Additionally, According to the control experiments, there were only 9 % and 18 % yields achieved under dark conditions and in the absence of photocatalyst DT, respectively. It indicates that light illumination and catalysts are indispensable for such high photocatalytic performance. Valence band XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) and Mott-Schottky measurements were performed to evaluate the valance band (VB) and conduction band (CB) potentials. According to Fig. 3b and the formula EVB, NHE= φ-4.44 + EXPS [13], the VB position of DT can be calculated as 1.25 V. Based on the bandgap calculated from the above solid UV−vis DRS, the band gap energy (Eg) of the DT is 2.79 eV. Thus, the CB position from DT is −1.54 V (vs NHE at pH = 7), which is consistent with the obtained CB potential from Mott-Schottky (Fig. S3). This CB position is no more negative than the −1.9 V (vs NHE at pH = 7) that can promote the activation of CO2 to CO2 ·−, illustrating that the photogenerated electrons produced from DT cannot be transferred directly to reduce CO2 [14]. EPR (Electron Paramagnetic Resonance) control experiments were conducted to monitor proposed radical generation using TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl) as a spin-trapping agent. As shown in Fig. 3d-f, the signals of Lorentzian lines can be ascribed to the unpaired electrons of TEMPO. The EPR of DT in three surroundings (N2, CO2, and N2 with epichlorohydrin) showed a similar phenomenon: the intensities in dark conditions were higher than that upon light irradiation, and the intensity radios of I (light)/ I (dark) are 0.78, 0.63, and 0.94, respectively. The peak intensity decreased by 22 % in an atmosphere of N2, due to the transfer of the produced photogenerated electrons to TEMPO under light irradiation. In the atmosphere of CO2, the signal intensity decreased by 37 % under light irradiation, indicating that the photogenerated electrons are not transferred to CO2. In contrast, a slight decrease of 6 % in signal intensity was found with N2 atmosphere in the presence of epichlorohydrin under light irradiation, demonstrating the transfer of more photogenerated electron/hole to epichlorohydrin, which is consistent with previous works FeOX/O-g-C3N4 [12] and ZIS/ZNC-0.03 [15]. Moreover, photocurrent measurements were employed to determine the ability of photogenerated electrons and holes under different conditions. As shown in Fig. S4, a significant enhancement of photocurrent signal was found in the presence of epichlorohydrin, indicating that the addition of epoxide substrate can enhance the separation efficiency of photo-induced electrons/holes. On the other hand, the current signal changed slightly when CO2 gas was pumped into the tested system, mainly because the addition of CO2 has a limited contribution to the separation of the photogenerated carriers. It is consistent with the EPR results and strongly demonstrates the crucial role of photogenerated carriers in the ring-opening of epoxide rather than CO2 reduction. In addition, the reduction peak of epichlorohydrin with a half-peak potential (Eₚ/₂) of −2.90 V vs Hg/Hg₂Cl₂ was determined via cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments (Fig.S5a), which was converted to −2.70 V vs the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) in N2 atmosphere. However, the reduction peak of epichlorohydrin remained observable under CO₂ atmosphere, indicating that epichlorohydrin is preferentially reduced. Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra (Fig. S5b) analysis was employed to investigate the interaction between epichlorohydrin and DT. A shift in the C-O-C ring stretching vibration peak from 1267 cm⁻¹ to 1272 cm⁻¹ was found after light exposure, demonstrating the presence of interaction between photogenerated carriers and the epoxide oxygen atom. These results strongly proved DT enables the facilitation of epoxide ring-opening via the photogenerated carriers. Significantly, the amino groups on DT can provide abundant basic sites, which are known as one of the active sites for CO2 activation [16]. Therefore, the introduced photocatalyst DT enables both the facilitation of epoxide ring-opening via the photogenerated carriers and the activation of CO2 via the abundant basic sites. Based on the above experimental results and previous works [15,16], a possible reaction mechanism for the photocatalytic CO2 cycloaddition over DT was proposed in Scheme 1. First, the photogenerated holes formed from DT under light irradiation act as Lewis acid sites to coordinate with the oxygen of epichlorohydrin. Subsequently, photogenerated electrons would transfer to the activated epoxide to generate an electron-rich intermediate [15], which can interact with nucleophilic reagent TBAB to form a ring-opening intermediate. The generated ring-opening intermediate could further interact with the activated CO2 by the Lewis basic amino groups. Ultimately, the target cyclic carbonate was generated after undergoing an intramolecular cyclization process. 3.4 The CO2 cycloaddition reaction under natural conditions Given its excellent photocatalytic performance in blue-LED light irradiation, the cycloaddition reaction was further carried out under natural conditions. As shown in Fig. 4, a good yield of 68 % carbonate was obtained with sunlight as the driving force with 16 h, implying that the provided commercial photocatalytic system has great potential in practical application for direct utilization of solar energy. 4 Conclusions A commercially available, metal-free, and highly efficient photocatalytic system was developed here to convert CO2 into valuable cyclic carbonates under visible-light irradiation/ solvent-free/ mild conditions. Photocatalyst DT with abundant Lewis basic sites possesses a specific structure containing both π-π and p-π conjugation, showing good optical performance. In combination with a series of control and photoelectronic experiments have been demonstrated that the introduced photocatalyst DT enables both facilitation of epoxide ring-opening via the photogenerated carriers and activation of CO2 via the abundant basic sites. Moreover, this catalytic system can directly utilize natural sunlight to produce the corresponding cyclic carbonate.
