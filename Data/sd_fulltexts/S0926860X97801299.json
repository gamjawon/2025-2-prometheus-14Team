The influence of the platinum content and the calcination temperature has been investigated by activity measurements for total oxidation of methane, naphthalene and carbon monoxide in the presence of steam and carbon dioxide, and by the temperature programmed reduction (TPR) technique. Manganese oxide behavior is influenced by the presence of even very small amounts of platinum especially when the catalyst is calcined at a higher temperature due to favorable synergetic effects.

Introduction It will be necessary to reduce the emissions of PAH, VOC and carbon monoxide from wood boilers in the future due to more stringent regulations in many countries [1-3]. One way to lower the emissions is by complete catalytic oxidation. Supported palladium and platinum are among the most widely used catalysts for oxidation [4,5]. Due to the high costs of noble metals, metal oxides which are less expensive and in the same time more resistant to poisoning [6,7] are also of interest. A combination of noble metals and metal oxides may make it possible to lower the amount of noble metals and favorable synergetic effects for activity and stability may also be achieved. Platinum is, compared to palladium, more poison resistant [8]. Among the transition metal oxides manganese oxides are among the * Corresponding author.

Also manganese oxide, compared with for example copper oxide, presents a low volatility at high temperatures in presence of steam [9] and reacts only very little with alumina to form spinel aluminate, MnA1204, of low activity [11]. Manganese oxides have been studied as catalysts for oxidation reactions alone [9,10], and in mixtures with among other components CuO or silver [9]. Alumina-supported manganese oxides in combination with platinum are studied in the present paper. When studying catalysts for abatement of emissions from small-scale combus- tion of wood, it is of great importance to study the activity in the presence of several combustible components and steam, since the behavior of a single component may not be the same as in mixtures with others [12]. Very little has been reported in the literature of research into the catalytic oxidation of mixtures as compared to the catalytic oxidation of individual components [6]. In the present study, monolithic manganese oxide catalysts, prepared by a deposition-precipitation method and promoted with platinum, have been investigated. The effect of platinum in the mixed catalysts has been studied both concerning the total oxidation of methane, naphthalene and carbon monoxide in presence of steam and carbon dioxide, as well as concerning its effect on the reduction temperature for manganese oxides. The calcination temperature and the concentration of platinum have been varied. For catalyst characterization BET, ICE X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) have also been used. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation Monolithic cordierite catalysts with a cell density of 400 cpsi, supplied by Coming were used. The washcoat was made of alumina and the active phase consisted of both manganese oxide and platinum. The alumina was impregnated with the active phase using a deposition-precipitation method and then applied onto the cordierite. According to literature [13,14] deposition-precipitation, with urea as precipitating agent, makes it possible to obtain a well-adhered and well- distributed active material on the alumina. The alumina used was commercial 7- alumina (Puralox SBA-170, Condea Chemie GmbH) and boehmite (Disperal S, Condea Chemie GmbH) with specific surface areas of 171 and 202 mZ/g, respec- tively. The total pore volume was 0.5 cm3/g and the mean particle size was 50 ~tm for both materials. Boehmite was used as a binder since 7-alumina has no cohesive properties in itself. Manganese nitrate (Mn(NO3)z.4H20, Merck, 98.5%) and urea (Riedel-de HaEn, 99.5%), with a molar ratio Mn : urea of 1 : 9 [15], were added to a suspension of alumina powder in acetic acid. Platinum salt was then added in order to produce co-impregnated catalysts. The amounts of salt were calculated in order to obtain a manganese loading of 9 mol% and a platinum loading ranging J. Carn6 et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 155 (1997) 265-281 267 from 0.01 to I mol% of the washcoat, counted as A1203. The slurry was ball-milled overnight, in order to bring down the alumina mean particle size to around 5 gm and to have a homogeneous suspension before the precipitation of the precursor. The suspension was stirred for 5 h at 90. At this temperature urea decomposes resulting in a gradual pH-increase causing precipitation of manganese hydroxide ions which anchor to the alumina surface via reaction with its OH groups [14]. Nitrogen was bubbled through the solution to avoid oxidation of manganese, which would lead to less soluble compounds such as 7-MnOOH or Mn304 [9]. To obtain a slurry suitable for dip-coating the monoliths, the slurry was dried overnight at 200, dissolved in water (20 wt% dry substance) and ball-milled overnight. Monoliths were immersed in the slurry, with pH 6, for around 6 min. The excess slurry was removed by blowing air through the channels. Several dips, followed by drying at 200 for around 4 h, were needed to get a washcoat loading of approximately 25 wt% of the total catalyst weight, the exact values are shown in Table 1. Finally, the catalysts were calcined at 500 or 800 for 4 h in air. The BET surface area was 182 m2/g and 144 m2/g for manganese oxide catalysts calcined at 500 and 800, respectively, and changed only slightly when platinum was added (Table 2). Part of the washcoat slurry was dried and calcined in the same way as for the monoliths and used for characterization. 2.2. Characterization Quantitative measurements of the platinum and manganese content in the washcoat were made using inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy, ARL 3520 B ICP analyzer (Table 1).

At 95% conversion of methane (750), the BET surface area is 162 m2 g i. BET surface area and pore volume were determined by nitrogen adsorption using a Micromeritics ASAP 2000. Samples were outgassed in vacuum at 250 before the adsorption measurements. XPS analyses were performed on a Kratos XSAM 800 instrument using a magnesium anode (1253.6 eV). Charging effects were corrected for by adjusting the A1 2p peak to a position at 74.6 eV. Sensitivity factors used in the quantitative analyses were O ls 0.66, C ls 0.25, A1 2p 0.19, Mn 2p 2.6 and Pt 4d5/2 2.88. For temperature programmed reduction (TPR) experiments a Micromeritics TDP/TPR 2900 instrument, equipped with a thermal conductivity detector, was used. The sample amount was always close to 310 mg and the particle size was 250-400 gm. The gas mixture was 10 mol% Hz/Ar with the flow of 50 ml/min. The heating rate was 5/min. The water produced during the TPR experiments was removed in a cold trap filled with a mixture of liquid nitrogen and 2-propanol. Calibration of the hydrogen consumption was accomplished by reduction of CuO. The O/Mn molar ratio of the catalysts were calculated from measured hydrogen consumption of the samples. X-ray powder analyses were performed with a Guinier-H~igg focusing camera using CuKc~l radiation (A=1.54059,~). Silicon was used as an internal standard. The reflection intensities were evaluated with an automatic film scanner [16] and the SCANPI program was used for processing the data [ 17]. The obtained diffraction patterns were identified using the JCPDS-data base. 2.3. Activity measurements The catalysts' activity for oxidizing carbon monoxide, methane and naphthalene in a gas mixture was tested for fresh and hydrothermally treated catalysts, i.e. exposed to an air flow of 1000 ml/min with 12% steam for 20 h at 800.

The composition of the gas mixture used for activity testing was chosen to resemble flue gas from wood boilers (Table 3). Also, one experiment was performed with only carbon monoxide as the combustible component. The reactor used was a vertical tubular Inconel reactor placed in a tubular oven and the catalyst was placed in the middle of the heated zone. During the activity tests the temperature of the furnace was increased from 100 to 800 with a heating rate of 3/rain. The temperature gradient was less than 1% over the catalyst bed. Before each experiment the catalyst was exposed to the gas mixture at 100 for about 3 h to reach steady-state conditions. Space velocity in the experiments was 23 000 h-l, which is reasonable for wood boilers. The total flow was 2500 ml/min, the catalyst volume was 6.5 ml, height 2.0 cm and diameter 2.0 cm. Naphthalene was brought to the reactor by a flow of nitrogen, 200 ml/min, bubbled through a bed of naphthalene (180 mm high and 100 mm in diameter), placed inside a box held at 45+0.1. This made the concentration of naphthalene in the gas mixture constant over time. Water was fed to the system by a continuous pump, vaporized in a heated tube and mixed with air, 1100 ml/min, before being mixed with the other gases. Carbon monoxide, methane and carbon dioxide were taken from gas bottles. The methane and naphthalene content of the leaving gases was analyzed every half minute using a gas chromatograph equipped with a FID, HP5890. Carbon monoxide was analyzed by an infrared spectrophotometer, BINOS100. The conversion of carbon monoxide, methane and naphthalene was determined as a function of the gas inlet temperature to the catalyst assumed to be close to the catalyst inlet temperature. The average deviation of the temperature between two activity tests, measured for a certain conversion, was 2. It is difficult to make an accurate mass balance closure since there is 12% carbon dioxide in the inlet gas mixture to the catalysts and the amount of carbon dioxide produced from 200 ppm methane, 50 ppm naphthalene and 2550 ppm carbon monoxide is small compared to that. Therefore carbon dioxide was excluded in the gas mixture, which resulted in a carbon mass balance closure of around 95%, when oxidizing carbon monoxide or methane. The apparatus for the activity tests is described in more detail elsewhere [12]. 270 J. Carn6 et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 155 (1997) 265-281 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Activity measurements The oxidation of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons could be affected by the presence of other components in a gas mixture. The oxidation of carbon monoxide, for example, is strongly hindered by the presence of naphthalene, Fig. 1. Since the activities of the catalysts also vary for different components several combustible components, representative for the exhausts from wood combustion, were included in the gas mixture used in the activity tests reported here. 3.2. Manganese oxide catalysts - influence of calcination temperature The conversion of carbon monoxide, naphthalene and methane as a function of gas inlet temperature is shown in Fig. 2(a)-(c) for supported manganese oxide catalysts calcined at 500 and 800, and for a washcoated monolithic support without any active phase. The catalyst calcined at 500 has a lower light-off temperature for naphthalene and carbon monoxide. The temperature for 50% conversion, Tso, has decreased by 50 for naphthalene and by 80 for carbon monoxide. However, there is a sudden decrease in the oxidation rate for carbon monoxide at 380 and 78% conversion for the catalyst calcined at 500, which is also observed to a small extent, though at 420, for the catalyst calcined at the higher temperature. The temperature for complete combustion of carbon monoxide is similar for both catalysts. For methane oxidation the variation of calcination temperature has no influence on the activity of the catalysts. It may only be seen that oxidation of methane begins at a lower temperature with catalyst present though total conversion of methane may be achieved only at temperatures around 750, at which the role of homogeneous oxidation reactions is significant. The sudden change in the conversion curve for carbon monoxide around 400 during the activity tests may be due to phase transformations of the manganese oxide but it 100 80. -~ 20 0~ 150 ; i 200 2NI Cat~yst ir~t m'qon-ntum I3 Fig. 1.

Carn6 et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 155 (1997) 265-281 does not seem reasonable since the catalyst has already been treated at 500. One experiment was performed without any steam in the gas mixture resulting in lower temperatures for oxidation of the hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. At around 400, when the conversion of methane was 5%, an abrupt change in the conversion curve (not shown) was observed similar to the one for carbon monoxide when steam was included in the gas mixture. This shows that an abruption in the conversion curve may not necessarily be due to diffusion limitations or steam being present during the activity tests. That diffusion limitations are not present was also observed using different gas flows at constant space velocity. Also, a catalyst calcined in steam behaved similarly to those as when calcined normally in air. The reason why phase transformations nevertheless seem to occur during the experi- ments may be due to the presence of the complex reaction medium since one experiment performed on a catalyst calcined at 500 in the gas mixture used for activity measurements, did not result in any abruption of the curve and the complete oxidation was reached at a lower temperature (not shown). Possibly a stabilization of the active manganese oxide phase was brought about when the catalyst was treated in this way. For alumina-supported manganese oxide catalysts calcined at 500 the manganese phase is mainly MnO2 and for the catalyst calcined between 600 and around 8000C the phase is mainly Mn203 [11]. According to thermodynamic data MnO2 is converted to Mn203 between 500 and 600 in oxidative atmosphere [19]. The temperature for complete combus- tion of carbon monoxide is similar for both catalysts, despite the difference in the surface area, so when carbon monoxide conversion reaches completion the MnO2 phase in the catalysts calcined at 500 is probably converting to become identical to the phase in the catalyst calcined at 800, Fig. 2(b). When naphthalene is combusted, the higher activity of the catalyst calcined at 500 probably depends on the higher activity of the manganese phase formed at 500 compared to 800 and not on the larger surface area of the catalyst calcined at 500 (Table 2). When the oxidation of methane starts, the temperature is so high that no difference in the phases between the catalysts remains and the activity is the same, despite the difference in the surface area. One experiment with an increasing temperature ramp up to 600 followed by a decreasing ramp was performed for a manganese oxide catalyst calcined at 500. It showed that the activity during the decrease was similar to that of the catalyst calcined at 800. 3.3. Platinum catalysts - influence of calcination temperature For the catalysts prepared by our method containing only platinum, the lower calcination temperature gave higher activity for all three components in the gas mixture, as seen for the lower Tso values in Table 4. Platinum could be more active after exposure to higher temperatures than 500 due to formation of larger metallic crystallites [6]. This possible positive change in the platinum structure is J.

Fig. 3 clearly shows that higher the concentration of platinum, the higher the activity. Even very low amounts of platinum, such as 0.05 mol% of the washcoat amount, have effect on the activity for oxidation of carbon monoxide and naphthalene.

As seen in Fig. 4(a) and (b), the catalysts calcined at 500 required higher amounts of platinum to signifi- cantly increase the activity, 0.1 mol% Pt for carbon monoxide and 0.5 mol% Pt for naphthalene oxidation. The activity for methane oxidation is not as affected by the addition of platinum at low concentrations. The superiority of platinum to manganese oxides seems to be less pronounced for methane oxidation than for oxidation of the other compounds. According to Table 5 an amount of 1 mol% Pt is necessary to enhance the activity.

Influence of calcination temperature for mixed catalysts The calcination temperature, rcalc, is of vital importance for the extent to which platinum in manganese oxide/platinum catalysts improves the activity compared to manganese oxide catalysts alone. Platinum increased the activity much more when 800 was used as calcination temperature than when 500 was used, which partly can be due to the lower activity of the pure manganese oxide catalyst calcined at 800. For example, as can be seen in Fig. 4(b) and Fig. 3(b), an addition of 0.5 mol% platinum to the manganese oxide catalyst decreased Tso for carbon monoxide by 65 when Tcalc=500 and as much as 190 with Tcalc=800. The same trend is seen for naphthalene, where T50 decreased by 20 and by 115 for Tcalc=500 and 800, respectively (Fig. 4(a) and Fig. 3(a)). There is a tendency that with increasing platinum content in the catalysts, from 0.05 to 0.5 mol%, the activities for catalysts calcined at 800 gain more and more over those calcined at 500. When there is no platinum or when the concentration of platinum is 0.01 mol% the catalysts calcined at 500 are the most active. When the platinum concentration is 0.05 mot% the catalysts calcined at 500 are most active for naphthalene whereas the catalysts with Tcalc=800 are better for carbon monoxide. At higher concentrations of platinum, 0.1 and 0.5 mol%, 800 as calcination temperature makes the most active catalysts for both carbon monoxide and naphthalene which is shown for 0.5 mol% of platinum in Fig. 5. However, pure manganese oxide as well as pure platinum catalysts were more active when calcined at 500 instead of 800 as discussed earlier in connection with Fig. 2 and Table 4. Thus it may be assumed that the higher activity for the mixed catalysts exposed to the higher temperature is due to some favorable synergetic effects. 100 80 ~6o il o 20 0 o= g , I CO 8000C Naphthalene 8000C a CO 5000C o Naphthalene 500 150 200 250 300 350 400 Catalyst inlet temperature () Fig. 5.

Naphthalene versus carbon monoxide In the selected experimental conditions where the concentration of naphthalene is 50 ppm and the concentration of carbon monoxide is 2550 ppm, naphthalene starts to oxidize at a lower temperature than carbon monoxide for the catalysts containing only manganese oxide, as can be seen by comparing Fig. 2(a) with Fig. 2(b). The opposite is valid for the catalysts containing only platinum as can be seen in Table 4, since platinum is highly active for carbon monoxide oxidation. The component which oxidizes first for the mixed catalysts depends on the platinum concentration. With 1% platinum in the mixed catalysts, calcined at both 500 and 800, the combustion of carbon monoxide appears at a lower temperature than for naphthalene, which can be seen by comparing Fig. 3(a) with Fig. 3(b) and Fig. 4(a) with Fig. 4(b). When the platinum concentration is 0.05 mol% or lower, naphthalene combustion starts at a lower temperature than that of carbon monoxide. Accordingly, when the platinum concentration is increased carbon monoxide will be oxidized at temperatures closer to that of naphthalene oxidation. This gradual change occurs at lower platinum concentra- tions for the catalysts calcined at 800. After exposing the catalysts to an air flow of 1000 ml/min with 12% steam for 20 h at 800 a second set of activity tests was performed. These did not show any change in the activity, for any catalysts calcined at 800, for oxidation of carbon monoxide and naphthalene, and only a very slight decrease for oxidation of methane which means that the activity of the catalysts was reasonably stabilized by the chosen preparation method and pre-treatment. 3.7. X-ray diffraction XRD analyses were performed on catalysts calcined at 500 and 800 in order to find out if there were any crystalline phases and, if so, which. The two diffractograms did not differ considerably. Two diffraction peaks were identified indicating the presence of small particles of'7-A1203 as well as particles of Mn203, Bixbyite-C. The peaks were short and broad which suggest that the manganese oxide was finely dispersed on the alumina support. On the sample treated at 800 the diffraction peaks were somewhat narrower and higher. Probably there are other amorphous phases of manganese oxides such as, MnO2, not visible on the diffractograms. 3.8. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS analyses were performed in order to find which phases of manganese oxide the fresh catalysts contained and whether possibly some manganese/platinum compound had been formed. The analyses were carried out on catalyst samples containing only manganese or platinum or the mixture of them calcined at 500 J.

The Mn 2p3/2 photoelectron binding energy (BE), for the manganese oxide catalysts shown in Table 6 corresponds to the literature value for bulk MnO2, BE is 642.6 eV for MnO2 and 641.9 eV for Mn203 [11,20]. These values do not necessarily have to be the same for supported manganese oxides. After calcination at 800 the Mn 2p3/2 was shifted towards slightly lower binding energies indicating a slightly lower mean oxidation state for manganese. Most likely the sample contained a mixture of different oxides. The XPS atomic ratio of Mn 2p3/2/A1 2p was increased after calcination at 800 which is probably due to surface enrichment of manganese caused by the decreased specific surface area of the alumina oxide (Table 2). An alteration of the environment of the active species occurs, when they are mixed, is seen in two ways. First, the Pt 4d5/2 binding energy has increased notably for the platinum mixed with manganese oxide as compared to that of supported platinum alone. Second, the O/A1 ratio has decreased remarkably for mixed manganese/ platinum catalysts compared to that of manganese catalysts alone. 3.9. Temperature programmed reduction Platinum, in mixed manganese oxide/platinum catalysts, significantly affects the reduction behavior of the oxide. A possible explanation for that could be that platinum and manganese are in intimate contact and therefore can affect each other by spill-over of hydrogen atoms from platinum to manganese or by nucleation of hydrogen molecules to atoms by platinum making the hydrogen more reactive [21 ]. Platinum influences the TPR-profiles in several ways: the shape of the curves, the number of peaks, the reduction rate and temperature. The reduction profiles for mixed manganese oxide/platinum catalysts as well as for manganese oxide catalysts are shown in Fig. 6(a) for 500 as calcination temperature and in Fig. 6(b) for 800. For the catalysts with only manganese oxide as the active phase the reduction sequence is probably MnO2 or Mn203 ~ Mn304 =~ MnO [11,22]. After the experiments, the samples were green which is the colour of bulk MnO. Further reduction to metallic manganese does not proceed until over 1200. Maybe the first of the three peaks for the sample calcined at 500 278 J. Carn6 et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 155 (1997) 265-281 can be attributed to MnO2 ~ Mn203. The catalyst calcined at the higher temperature is reduced later indicating larger particles as was also indicated in the XRD analyses. The amount of hydrogen consumed during the reduction remains constant for all the catalysts calcined at 800 and the O/Mn molar ratio is close to 1.6. For the catalysts calcined at 500 the ratio is also 1.6 for the manganese sample but increases with increasing amount of platinum and reaches 1.95 when the platinum amount is 1%. This increase of the O/Mn ratio cannot be attributed to an oxygen increase caused by platinum oxide, since the reduction of a 1% platinum catalyst causes a very low hydrogen consumption. The O/Mn ratio of Mn203 does not usually exceed 1.50 [9], so most probably there is a mixture of oxides in the catalysts. The used manganese oxide catalyst calcined at 500 has a TPR pattern similar to that of the fresh catalyst calcined at 800. After an activity test ended at 600 the shape of the TPR curve is similar too, even if the reduction temperature is not as high. When the test is ended at 320 the reduction behavior of the catalyst is more similar to that of the fresh catalyst calcined at 500. For the fresh catalysts calcined at 500 shown in Fig. 6(a), the reduction rate is slow in the beginning and the onset of the reduction appears approximately at the same g E o~ == o } / / Pt (1~ mol%!Pt) Mn-Pt (0.5 mol% Pt) Mn-Pt (().1 molto Pt) Mn-Pt (0.05 mcil% Pt) Mn-Pt (Q.01 mol% Pt) Mn! i 200 400 600 800 Temperature () Fig. 6.

(Continued). temperature for the manganese oxide catalysts as well as for the mixed catalysts with an amount of platinum up to 0.1%. But already at an addition of 0.01 mol% Pt the relation between the peaks are changed considerably. When 0.01 mol% Pt is added the first peaks at lower temperature grow and the third one diminishes. With 0.05 mol% Pt, this is more pronounced and with 0.1 mol% Pt, the third peak has been reduced to a shoulder. When the platinum content is 0.5 and 1 mol%, the reduction appears as a single step. However, a small peak at 466 is also visible. Platinum, in the mixed catalysts calcined at 800, has even stronger influence on the reduction profile of manganese oxide than it does for the corresponding catalysts calcined at 500. For the mixed catalysts calcined at 800 (Fig. 6(b)), excluding the one with 1 mol% platinum, the reduction rate is high and results in narrow single peaks at lower temperatures than for manganese oxide alone. However, for all the mixed samples calcined at 800 a part of the oxide is more difficult to reduce, hydrogen uptake is seen up to 500, indicating a stronger interaction with the support for these samples. The temperatures for the peak maximum are similar for catalysts containing 0.01, 0.05 and 0.1 mol% platinum but the temperature for the start of the reduction is somewhat lowered with higher platinum content. The TPR results show that as low a molar ratio of Pt/Mn as ! : 1000 affects the reduction behavior of manganese oxide to a great extent. It has 280 J. Carn6 et al./Applied Catalysis A: General 155 (1997) 265-281 been observed earlier that noble metals catalyze the reduction of an oxide of a less noble metal e.g. Co-Rh [21,23], Ni-Ru [24], but generally the amount of noble metals has been much higher. The catalytic effect of platinum on the reduction of manganese oxide is consistent with the positive effect of platinum on the activity for oxidation. Platinum has stronger influence on the reduction profile of man- ganese oxide for the catalysts treated at 800 compared to those treated at 500. This can particularly be correlated to the fact that platinum in the mixed catalysts treated at the higher temperature also has much greater effect on the catalysts' oxidation capacity compared to that of the manganese oxide catalysts alone. 4. Conclusions Calcination temperatures of 500 and 800 result in different manganese oxide phases as shown by the different numbers of peaks and their shapes in the TPR analyses and by their different oxidation capacity. The ratios between the different manganese oxides in the catalysts depend on the calcination temperature. Mn203 is detected both in the catalysts calcined at 500 and at 800, the presence of MnO2 is also expected in the catalysts calcined at 500. A calcination temperature of 500 results in a formation of a more active manganese oxide catalyst for the oxidation of carbon monoxide and naphthalene, provided that the catalysts are not exposed to much higher temperatures than that of the pre- treatment which result in transformation of the manganese oxide phase. Methane oxidation occurs at a higher temperature than that of the pre-treatment, conse- quently the activity is equal for both catalysts. The pure platinum catalysts are more active for all combustibles in this study when calcined at 500. The greater the amount of platinum added to the manganese oxide catalysts, the higher the activity compared to that of the manganese oxide catalysts alone. However, the methane oxidation is not affected by small additions of platinum, so manganese oxide may be used to substitute the more expensive platinum in this case. Pure platinum catalysts are better than mixed manganese/platinum catalysts for oxida- tion of naphthalene and carbon monoxide which we believe is due to encapsulation of platinum by manganese oxides. Despite the fact that pure manganese oxide and pure platinum catalysts are more active when calcined at 500 compared to 800, the mixed catalysts with a molar ratio Pt/Mn of 1 : 100 to 1 : 20 are more active when calcined at the higher temperature. Platinum also significantly affects the reduction behavior of manganese oxide, also to a greater extent for the catalysts calcined at 800. This suggests intimate contact of platinum and manganese which result in favorable synergetic effects.
