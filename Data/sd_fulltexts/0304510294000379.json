Khan, Kenneth M. Nicholas* Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Oklahoma, Norman OK 73019, USA (Received October 15, 1993; accepted January 18, 1994) Abstract A series of chiral MLZ complexes of Pd, Cu and Ni [L*=2-trifluoroacetylcamphorato (tfacam), (R)-N-a-methylbenzylsalicylaldimine, 2-(2'-phenolato)-4-substituted-oxazoline (phenox)] have been prepared and characterized, including X-ray structures of Pd(tfacam)z (1) and Pd(4-Phphenox)Z (3a). The Pd- and Cu-chelates are active (pre) catalysts for the allylic acetoxylation of alkenes. The yields and chemoselectivities in these reactions are high but little enantioselectivity (05%) was found. Several mechanistic probes, including tests of the stability of the product and PdL2 under the reaction conditions, the product distribution from the acetoxylation of D-1-cyclohexene, and the low acetolysis reactivity of L*Pd( r)3-allyl), indicate the intervention of ( nT-allyl)-Pd intermediates in the catalytic process in which either or both L* groups dissociate or at least dechelate in the product-forming step. Key words: acetoxylation; alkenes; allylic derivatives; chiral chelates; palladium 1. Introduction Among the general approaches that have been employed to construct chiral molecules, the ideal is chiral induction of achiral or chiral racemic starting materials by a chiral catalyst. This method allows the chirality present in a relatively small amount of material, i.e., in the catalyst, to be amplified to produce a large amount of a chiral product. In this connection, we were interested in developing methods for the asymmetric synthesis of allylically functionalized alkenes from achiral alkenes using chiral metal catalysts since the allylic esters so produced are versatile building blocks in *Corresponding author; fax.

Yang et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 319-334 the synthesis of more complex compounds. There have been several investigations of catalytic allylic oxidation of alkenes catalyzed by metal complexes (Eq. 1) . The earliest studies employed copper salts as catalysts with peroxide or perester oxidants in acetic acid for the production of allylic acetates [ 1 ] . Palladium salts, such as chloride and acetate, have received more recent attention with manganese dioxide, t-butyl hydroperoxide, or molecular oxygen as stoichiometric oxidants in acetic acid solution [ 2 ] . However, there have been few reported attempts and only limited success in the development of asymmetric versions of these reactions. An early report and a patent found low stereoselectivities using either stoichiometric or catalytic amounts of chiral Cu carboxylates [3,4]. Recently, using in situ-formed Cu-amino acid complexes as catalysts 2-cyclohexenyl acetate has been produced from cyclohexene in up to 30% ee [ 5 ] . R2 R3 (01 R2 R3 R>-( R4 MX2 , HOAC R~R4 (M = Pd, Cu) OAc Before the rational design of a chiral catalyst for allylic oxidation is possible, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms of these reactions. Unfortunately, the detailed mechanisms of the copper and the palladium-catalyzed reactions are not well elucidated. Two possible pathways have been proposed for the Pd(OAc) 2 catalyzed reactions based on product distributions from various alkenes: (1) formation of an -q3-allyl palladium complex followed by nucleophilic attack of acetate and (2) acetoxypalladation to produce a palladium alkyl complex and subsequent ,6-hydride elimination (Scheme 1). The 1,2-acetoxypalladation pathway appears R + HOAc 'Pd Pd(OAc) Pd(OAc _HPd( Ac R Ac0 Scheme 1 to be favored for terminal linear alkenes [ 6 ] . In the case of internal acyclic and cyclic alkenes, concurrent operation of both mechanisms seems to be the case with a delicate balance between the two depending on the alkene structure [ 2c,d] . The Cu-catalyzed reactions have been proposed to operate by the process outlined in Scheme 2 [ 1,7a] in which an allyl radical is produced which reacts with LCu(II)OAc togive the allylic acetate. Organocopper intermediates in this latter step have been implicated, in part, on the basis of the regio- and stereoselectivity (cisltrans) found with acyclic olefins (above) which is inconsistent with direct product formation from allyl radicals. A recent study has presented additional evidence, again from product selectivity, supporting the involvement of a novel H. Yang et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 319-334 321 Cu(111) complex which collapses via a pericyclic reaction (a reductive elimination with respect to the metal) [7a]. R2\\ / 3 tBLIO.

Our design of the asymmetric ligands aimed first at the putative 773-allyl intermediates involved in the Pd- (and possibly the Cu-) catalyzed acetoxylation reactions. Assuming that these species have the general structure L*M (q3-allyl) [ 8 ] , we sought chelating L* (to supress dissociation of the chiral ligand during catalysis) of similar electronic character to carboxylate and acetylacetonate (counterions in the known catalysts) and close proximity of the L* chirality to the metal active site. Eventually, to sterically and electronically distinguish the two termini of the allyl unit in the acetate delivery step, important to controlling regioselectivity (with unsymmetrical alkenes) and enantioselectivity (with symmetrical alkenes), the (N,O) -bidentate feature was selected [ 9 ] . 2. Results and discussion 2.1. Preparation and structure of metal chelates Some initial catalytic experiments were conducted with Pd(tfacam)2 (1, tfacam = 2-trifluoroacetylcamphorato), an 0,0-type chelate [ 10] . To provide information on the chiral environment of the metal center the structure of this complex was determined by X-ray diffraction (Fig. 1) . The geometry of 1 is essentially square planar with all Pd-O bond lengths approximately the same (1.98 A f 0.01) , giving little evidence for electronic asymmetry in the chelate. The relationship of the two tfacam ligands, which minimizes steric interactions, gives 1 approximate CZ symmetry but the metal's coordination sphere is rather insulated from the ligand chirality. 322 H.

Accordingly, (R)-N-a-methylbenzylsalicylaldimine was the first N,O-type chelate ligand used in our study. Complex 2 was prepared by treatment of the corresponding ligand with sodium palladate in aqueous alcoholic NaOH. Furthermore, in order to access a set of complexes with electronically tunable and more rigid ligands which would allow effective transmission of chirality to the metal, PdL2 complexes 3 of a new ligand type, 2-(2'-phenolato)2-oxazolines [ 12 ] , were also prepared by the same method in moderate to excellent yield. These rather stable yellow-orange or red crystalline solids were obtained analytically pure and were fully characterized spectroscopically (IR,NMR, UVVis, [a] ], and in the case of 3a by X-ray diffraction (Fig. 2). The structure of 3a is also seen to be essentially square planar with Cz molecular symmetry, the like donor atoms (N,N and 0,0) being trans to each other. The C4-chiral center on the oxazoline ring causes the phenyl substituent to project into the region where the olefin would coordinate (after loss of one L'H during catalysis). Copper(II) and nickel (11) salicyloxazolines 4, 5 also were prepared in a similar manner using copper(II) acetate and nickel(II) chloride, respectively. The copper(II) complexes are yellowish-green crystalline solids, whereas the nickel(II) derivatives, 5, are green (red in solution).

Catalytic oxidation of alkenes by PdL2 The Pd-catalyzed oxidations using 1-3 (0.5-1.0 mol%) were carried out in acetic acid solution with either Mn02 (1 equiv.) /benzoquinone (5 mol%) or tBu00H (1 equiv.) as stoichiometric oxidants at room temperature to inhibit potential product racemization and maximize enantioselectivity. With Pd (tfacam) 2 (1) as catalyst the oxidations of cyclohexene, cyclopentene, cycloheptene and 1-octene were examined using the Mn02/quinone oxidizing system. In each case at room temperature slow (2-3 day) but clean (70-90%) conversion to the corresponding allylic acetates occurred as indicated by GC/MS, IR and NMR analysis of the isolated crude product. The enantiomeric purity of the products derived from the cyclic alkenes (exclusively the allylic acetate) was assessed by optical rotation measurements and/or from 'H NMR spectra in the presence of the chiral NMR shift reagent tris-[3-(heptafluoropropylhydroxymethylene-( + )-camphorato ] europium (Eu (hfpcam) 3) . These revealed a modest enantiomeric excess (ca. 5-6%) in the production of cyclohexenyl acetate but essentially racemic products from cyclopentene and cycloheptene. The acetoxylation of 1-octene produced a mixture of 1-acetoxy-2-octene and 3-acetoxy-l-octene (ca. 1:4). The specific rotation (1.1 in hexane) of this mixture was small but non-zero. Thus, while 1 was found to be a catalyst (or precatalyst) for olefin allylic oxidation, modest asymmetric induction was observed. We then examined catalysis by the Pd complexes 2, 3 of the unsymmetrical N,Ochelates which would place the ligand stereocenter in closer proximity to the metal. Oxidation of allylbenzene catalyzed by 0.5 mol% of 2 under typical conditions (20 C, Mn02/BQ, HOAc) produced a mixture of products - cinnamyl acetate (42%) , cinnamaldehyde (25%) , and isomeric vinylic acetates (33%) as determined by GC/MS. The complexity of the mixture deterred us from assessing the enantiomeric purity of the chiral products. Interestingly, a-methyl styrene was inert under the same conditions and 1-octene was oxidized only very slowly ( > 5 days). The oxidation of cyclohexene catalyzed by 2 was carried out similarly and H. Yang et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 319-334 325 required 5-30 days for completion. No reaction occurs in the absence of catalyst. Temperature and concentration of substrate play an important role in the rate of reaction since reaction completion (signaled by conversion of black Mn02 to white Mri0) occurred only after 28 days using a 1% solution of cyclohexene in acetic acid at 20 C and in 14 days at 50 C; 7 days were required using 10% cyclohexene/ acetic acid solution. Only 2-cyclohexen-1-yl acetate was produced (70-80% yield), along with a trace (ca. 1 %) of cyclohexenol, observed by monitoring the reaction with GC. Disappointingly, however, the % e.e. value of the product was zero. The oxidation was completed in 3 days at room temperature using I equiv. of tert-butyl hydroperoxide instead of benzoquinone/Mn02, but still no enantioselectivity was found. Oxidations of cyclohexene catalyzed by palladium chelates of 2-salicyl-2-oxazoline 3a-a were carried out under the same conditions. Again, 2-cyclohexen-l-yl acetate was produced from cyclohexene in high yield (70-80%) but without enantioselectivity. In general, these palladium catalysts are less active than complexes 2 derived from salycylaldimine and less active than Pd(OAc)Z itself. The time required to complete the oxidation depends on the substituents on the oxazoline or phenolic ring-electron-withdrawing substituents (as with 3b, e) decreased the catalyst activity. Oxidations of other cycloalkenes catalyzed by 3a found cyclopentene to be more reactive than cyclohexene and cycloheptene to be the least reactive; the corresponding 2-cycloalkenyl acetates were produced with high selectivity in both cases. Cyclooctene was unreactive under these conditions. Similar reactivity trends have been observed with Pd(OAc)2 as catalyst [2c,d]. 2.3. Mechanistic studies The negligible enantioselectivities observed in these reactions prompted us to conduct various control and mechanistic experiments to identify the cause. First, the stability of the allylic acetates under the reaction conditions was investigated. Optically active 2-cyclohexenyl acetate was prepared via asymmetric reduction of cyclohexenone [ 15 ] followed by acetylation. When the optically active ester was stirred with Mn02, benzoquinone and catalyst 2 in acetic acid for 7 days, little conversion to other products occurred as probed by GC/MS monitoring and no change in the rotation of the recovered acetate resulted. Likewise, acetoxylation of a 1:1 mixture of optically active cyclohexenyl acetate and cyclohexene produced cyclohexenyl acetate with half the rotation of the starting acetate, as expected from no racemization of the original acetate plus stereo-random oxidation of cyclohexene. Additionally, phenylvinyl carbinyl acetate was not isomerized to the more stable cinnamyl acetate in the presence of 2 under typical reaction conditions. Therefore, in contrast to allylic oxidations catalyzed by Pd(OAc) Z [ 7 ] , the allylic acetate products are quite stable to isomerization in the presence of 2 and, presumably (though not tested) 3. 326 H. Yang et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 319-334 The observed product distribution in the catalytic oxidation of allylbenzene (above) suggests that the 1,2-acetoxypalladation pathway is favored in this case since: (1) a significant amount of the product was found to consist of vinylic acetates, which are unlikely to be generated via the r73-allyl complex pathway, and (2) no internal allylic acetate, phenylvinylcarbinyl acetate, which should be formed from acetolysis of the possible intermediate [ (R)-N-a-methylbenzylsalicylaldimine ] palladium [ 773-1-phenylallyl ] , was detected. Thus, stirring an acetic acid solution of this independently prepared complex [ 12] at room temperature for 12 h resulted in the formation of phenylvinyl ketone (3%), phenylvinylcarbinyl acetate (32%) , cinnamaldehyde (44%) and cinnamyl acetate (21 %) . In an effort to establish the relative importance of the acetoxypalladtion/sshydride elimination vs. rl3-allyl-Pd pathways (Scheme 1) , we examined the acetoxylation of D-1-cyclohexene. If the latter pathway was exclusively operative a 1:2:1 mixture of 2-cyclohexen-l-yl acetate-l-d, 2-cyclohexen-l-yl acetate-2-d, and 2-cyclohexen-l-yl acetate-3-d would be produced (ignoring secondary isotope effects) whereas an acetoxypalladation/ss-H(D) elimination pathway would result in the formation of equal amounts of the first and last isomers (plus vinyl acetates and none of the 2-d compound, Scheme 3). The labeled cyclohexene was acetoxylated under typical conditions using Pd(OAc)Z, 2 and 3a as catalysts. In all three cases the product was a mixture of 2-cyclohexen-1-yl acetate-l-d, 2-cyclohexen1-yl acetate-2-d and 2-cyclohexen-l-yl acetate-3-d in a 1: 2 :1 ratio as determined by ZH NMR spectroscopy. These results indicate that the acetoxylation of cyclohexene occurs in each case exclusively via an n3-allyl complex pathway. This finding is in contrast to the oxidation of some substituted cyclohexenes catalyzed by palladium acetate, which involves both pathways [2c,d].

The stability of the catalysts and the potential for dissociation of the chiral L* under catalytic conditions was also called into question. Indeed, earlier we reported that 2 slowly converts in acetic acid (3 days) into a novel cluster (sal-H)4Pd4 via acetolysis and orthometallation [ 16]. Nonetheless, the cluster still catalyzes the acetoxylation of cyclohexene to cyclohexenyl acetate, possibly via initial cluster fragmentation. H. Yang et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 319-334 327 On the other hand the 2-oxazolyl palladium complexes 3 apparently are stable in acetic acid. Solutions of 3a in DOAc showed no evidence of reaction over several days and the complex could be almost quantitatively recovered from such solutions. Furthermore, most ( > 80%) of 3a could be isolated after catalytic acetoxylation of cyclohexene. This stability may be attributable to the rigidity of the oxazoline ring, which renders the ortho hydrogens of the phenyl substituent inaccessible to the metal center. 2.4. Mechanistic discussion of the Pd-catalyzed acetoxylation of cyclohexene The following observations must be accommodated in formulating a mechanistic picture for the acetoxylations of cycloalkenes catalyzed by oxazoline-derived complexes 3: (1) the high chemo- and regioselectivity but negligible enantioselectivity observed; (2) the product distribution from the acetoxylation of D-1-cyclohexene; (3) the apparent unreactivity of (chelate) ZPd complexes 3 in acetic acid; (4) the configurational stability of the product under the reaction conditions; and (5) the low reactivity of L*Pd( 773-cyclohexenyl) [ 12] towards acetic acid, producing cyclohexenyl acetate with modest selectivity. Observation (2) points to the intervention of a Pd-773 -allyl intermediate but (5 ) argues against the intermediacy of L*Pd ( rl3-allyl) . How does one reconcile the Dlabeling experiments, which point to an n3-allyl intermediate, with the lack of enantioselectivity? We can envision at least two explanations: (1) the primary catalytically active species in all of the reactions is achiral Pd (OAc) 2, formed by complete acetolysis of PdL2 ; after the olefin is consumed subsequent reassociation of L*H would regenerate the PdLZ species; or (2) the active rj 3-allyl-Pd intermediate still possesses coordinated L* but that dechelation occurs before or at the time of acetate delivery, e.g., as below, distancing the ligand chirality from the metal center (Scheme 4) . The experiments to date do not allow us to distinguish these two alternatives. R'~ CC HOAc ' C> '>d-OAc C> < -HL \\R Ac HOAc cx~ Ac0 H OAc R. Scheme 4 2.5. Allylic acetoxylation catalyzed by copper chelates Copper(II) chelates 4 of the oxazoline-type ligands were also tested as catalysts for the acetoxylation of cyclohexene. The reactions were conducted at 70-80 C for 328 H. Yang et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysis 91 (1994) 319-3.34 24 h using t-Bu00H as the stoichiometric oxidant in acetic anhydride/ acetic acid. 2-Cyclohexenyl acetate was produced selectively and in good yield (60-80%) but the products were essentially racemic. No mechanistic experiments were conducted on these reactions but once again the possibility of partial or complete L` acetolysis or dechelation is recognized. The use of the Ni complexes, 4 as catalysts for asymmetric transformations will be reported in a future publication. 3. Summary and conclusions A series of ML* chelates of Pd, Cu and Ni have been prepared and characterized which possess the new salicyloxazoline type ligand. The Pd- and Cu chelates have been found to be active (pre) catalysts for the allylic acetoxylation of alkenes. Yields and chemoselectivities in these reactions are high but little enantioselectivity was found. Several mechanistic studies including tests of the stability of the product and PdL2 under the reaction conditions, the product distribution from the acetoxylation of D-1-cyclohexene, and the low reactivity of L*Pd( q3-allyl) indicates the intervention of r13-allyl Pd intermediates in a catalytic process in which both L* groups either dissociate or at least dechelate in the product-forming step. We believe that the salicyloxazoline-type ligands may still prove useful in asymmetric catalysis. They are suitable for accommodating moderate to high oxidation state metal ions, should be stable under moderately strong oxidizing conditions, and they offer a tunable, highly chiral environment in close proximity to the metal center. The latter feature is illustrated in our recent study of the rotational equilibria of the L*Pd( q3-cyclohexenyl) complexes in which the 5-substituent on the oxazoline ring is able to control the rotamer population [ 12 ] . Future studies will focus on the use of these and other complexes of salicyloxazolines as catalysts for other asymmetric transformations. 4. Experimenta NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian XL-300 FT-NMR spectrometer with CDC13 as the solvent unless otherwise noted. IR spectra were obtained on a Biorad FTS-7 IR spectrometer; mass spectra on VG ZAB-E or Kratos HRMS-25 mass spectrometers, UV-Vis spectra on a Hewlett Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer (in THF), and optical rotation measurements on a Rudolph Research Autopol III automatic polarimeter (in THE metal complexes, or hexanes: cyclohexenyl acetate). Mn02, benzoquinone, olefins and glacial acetic acid were used as obtained commercially without further purification. Pd(tfacam)Z (1) [10], optically active cyclohexenol [15], the salicyloxazoline ligands [12], and D-Icyclohexene [ 17 ] were prepared according to literature methods. H.

Yang et al. /Journal of Molecular Catalysts 91 (1994) 319-334 333 p-benzoquinone (22 mg, 0.20 mmol), the palladium complex (0.020 mmol), acetic acid (0.48 9, 8 mmol) and cyclohexene (1.O g, 20 mmol) in that order. The mixture was stirred at room temperature until the dark brown color of manganese dioxide had completely faded. The mixture was then poured into 10 ml of hexane and filtered. The residue was washed twice with hexane. The filtrate and combined hexane extracts were washed with water, 5% sodium bicarbonate and water again. The organic phase was dried over magnesium sulfate and the hexane was removed in vacuo to give 2-cyclohexenyl acetate as a yellowish oil (ca. 80-85 %) .

This mixture was stirred at 70-80 C for 12 h the solution was poured into 50 ml water and extracted with hexane (10 ml) three times. The combined hexane solution was washed by water, 5% sodium bicarbonate and water. This solution was dried over magnesium sulfate and the hexane was removed in vacuo to yield 2-cyclohexenyl acetate as a yellow liquid (0.27 g, 98 %) identified by comparison of its 'H NMR, IR and mass spectra with those of an authentic sample.

Nicholas ∗ Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Oklahoma, Norman OK 73019, USA * Corresponding author; fax. ( +1-405)3256111. A series of chiral ML★2 complexes of Pd, Cu and Ni [L★=2-trifluoroacetylcamphorato (tfacam), (R)-N-α-methylbenzylsalicylaldimine, 2-(2′-phenolato)-4-substituted-oxazoline (phenox)] have been prepared and characterized, including X-ray structures of Pd(tfacam)2 (1) and Pd(4-Ph-phenox)2 (3a). The Pd- and Cu-chelates are active (pre) catalysts for the allylic acetoxylation of alkenes. The yields and chemoselectivities in these reactions are high but little enantioselectivity (0–5%) was found. Several mechanistic probes, including tests of the stability of the product and PdL★2 under the reaction conditions, the product distribution from the acetoxylation of D-1-cyclohexene, and the low acetolysis reactivity of L★Pd(η3-allyl), indicate the intervention of (η3-allyl)-Pd intermediates in the catalytic process in which either or both L★ groups dissociate or at least dechelate in the product-forming step.

        "dc:description": "A series of chiral ML★2 complexes of Pd, Cu and Ni [L★=2-trifluoroacetylcamphorato (tfacam), (R)-N-α-methylbenzylsalicylaldimine, 2-(2′-phenolato)-4-substituted-oxazoline (phenox)] have been prepared and characterized, including X-ray structures of Pd(tfacam)2 (1) and Pd(4-Ph-phenox)2 (3a). The Pd- and Cu-chelates are active (pre) catalysts for the allylic acetoxylation of alkenes. The yields and chemoselectivities in these reactions are high but little enantioselectivity (0–5%) was found. Several mechanistic probes, including tests of the stability of the product and PdL★2 under the reaction conditions, the product distribution from the acetoxylation of D-1-cyclohexene, and the low acetolysis reactivity of L★Pd(η3-allyl), indicate the intervention of (η3-allyl)-Pd intermediates in the catalytic process in which either or both L★ groups dissociate or at least dechelate in the product-forming step.",
