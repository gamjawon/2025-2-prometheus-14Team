The focus of the study was put on the increase in homogeneity of the mixed gel as the precursor of crystallites. Proper treatments of the mixed gel such as application of ultrasonic waves, addition of a proper amount of the seed crystals and milling were found to be important to obtain a high crystallinity and a sharp distribution of crystal size. Incorporations of the crystal ingredients, P, Si, and Ni, into the framework of SAPO-34 were observed for those crystallites. The crystallites, which were 0.85-t-0.05 ~tm in size and had a solid acid density 4 lamol/m2 distributed inside the crystallites, exhibited the highest ethylene selectivity, 88%. The total conversion level of methanol was observed at a medium reaction temperature around 425. These crystallites exhibited a minor deactivation due to the lower amounts of coke formation. 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Introduction After the oil crisis, light olefin synthesis from methanol has been investigated extensively to search for an alternative economic route for supplying the basic raw materials of the petrochemical industry [ 1-9]. In the early stages of the study, considering the fit to the molecular sizes of light olefins, narrow pore size zeolites such as erionite and chabazite [1], chabazites modified with lanthanide oxides [3], ZSM-34 or off- retite-erionite intergrowth zeolite [10] and ZKU-4 or *Corresponding author.

PII S0926-860X(97)00 1 72-5 offretite synthesized by the rapid crystallization method [11] were used as the catalysts for this pur- pose. These catalysts exhibited a rather higher selec- tivity to ethylene than to propylene in methanol conversion reaction, but the short catalyst life caused by the coke deposits that occurred mainly in the spaces of their large cavities could not be avoided, even after many trials such as moderation of the acidity by basic materials [3] and regulation of crystallite size [11]. The focus of the study was then shifted to the medium pore size zeolites, especially H-ZSM-5, mod- ified with various basic metal oxides to moderate the excess acidity for the olefin synthesis from methanol [12]. For example, CaO [13] and phosphorus [14] 212 T. lnui, M. Kang/Applied Catalysis A: General 164 (1997) 211-223 were used as modifiers. Hrlderich et al. [15] used B- silicate, which was synthesized by the isomorphous substitution of B for A1 in ZSM-5. Since the acidity of the catalyst was reduced very much by those mod- ifications, the methanol conversion reaction was com- pelled to operate at a high temperature range around 550-600. This meant that fl-scission of carbenium ions became predominant and the main component of produced olefins was propylene, and the most requested ethylene was limited by low selectivity levels. Furthermore, formation of aromatics and con- sequent formation of aromatic coke could not be avoided. H-Fe-silicate [16] having MFI structure was then found to have a very high selectivity to ethylene and propylene with an equivalent molar ratio in methanol conversion at lower temperature ranges around 300. This was because of its intrinsically moderate acidity and also due to the property that it has almost no hydrogen shift function such as H-ZSM-5 has. After the innovation in synthesis of aluminopho- sphate molecular sieves by UCC [17], a trial of methanol conversion had been done using SAPO-34 as the catalyst for methanol conversion [ 18-20], and a rather high selectivity to ethylene and propylene were observed without serious coke formation, although the catalyst has an isomorph of chabazite. Remarkable results were then found by using Ni-SAPO-34 [21], on which ethylene was obtained from methanol with a selectivity of 88%, expressed by carbon weight per- cent, at a medium temperature, 450, at 100% methanol conversion without coke formation. Although Thomas et al. [22] succeeded in obtaining reproducible results in syntheses of Ni-SAPO-34 and its catalytic performance in methanol conversion, synthesis of such an extraordinarily highly selective catalyst is very sensitive to the properties of the catalyst, and then to the preparation procedure. There- fore, in order to establish the good reproducibility in its synthesis, physical properties, and catalytic per- formance, further investigation is indispensable. The most important factors to control the performance of this catalyst have been recognized by the early stages of these studies. These include the acidic properties to convert methanol to ethylene [21], crystal size and its distribution [ 11,23], and the uniform incorporation of the metal in isomorphous substitution into the frame- works of the crystals [23]. These factors are affected by the uniformity of the gel mixture as the precursors for crystallization, and the uniformity of the gel increases by the treatment of milling [23], and ultra- sonic waves [24]. The size of crystals and the size distribution are largely affected by the addition of the seed crystals [23]. Therefore, in the present study, the conditions of the gel mixture as the precursors for crystallization were varied, and the effects of ultrasonic treatment and addition of the seed crystals were observed. The milling treatment was generally used for maintaining the uniformity in mixed gel before the hydrothermal crystallization. Six kinds of crystal samples were prepared, and their basic physical properties and their catalytic performances for methanol to ethylene con- version were compared. The requisites for exerting the objective catalytic properties are summarized and the tasks for further improvements are discussed. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation In Fig. 1, the typical preparation procedure of the Ni-SAPO-34 catalyst is shown. Reagents used for preparation of the gel mixture were as follows: 35 wt% aqueous solution of tetraethyl ammonium hydroxide (TEAOH, Aldrich Chemical Company) was used as the organic template. Aluminum isoprop- oxide (AIP, Wako pure Chem.), cataloid-30 (30 wt% SiO2, Kasei Tesque), phosphoric acid (85 wt% H3PO4, Nacali Tesque) and nickel nitrate ((Ni(NO3)2.6H20, Nacalai Tesque) were used as the starting materials of AI, Si, P, and Ni ingredients of Ni-SAPO-34, respec- tively. The order of mixing of these starting materials is important to obtain a homogeneous gel mixture [25]. Since the present study is concentrated on the addi- tional treatments of the gel mixture once prepared, however, the best order of mixing is shown in proce- dure (1) of Fig. 1. The composition of the gel mixture is indicated in Fig. 1. Six kinds of different procedures were conducted for procedures (2), (4) and (5) of Fig. 1, and are listed in Table 1. Catalyst numbers shown in Table 1 are designated for these catalysts prepared by different methods. The treated gel mixture for Cats. 1-6 were crystallized by applying the rapid T. Inui, M.

Characterization of catalyst Characterization of the catalyst samples was con- ducted for the six kinds of catalyst by several methods, as listed in Table 2. 2.3. Reaction method and product analysis Each methanol conversion reaction was carried out by using an ordinary continuous flow reactor. A 0.325 g portion (0.35 ml) of the catalyst was packed into a quartz tubular reactor having 0.5 cm inner diameter, and a reaction gas composed of 15 mol% methanol and 85 mol% Ar was allowed to flow with a gaseous hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 1000 h-1 at a temperature range from 300 to 550, for 1-11 h. The products were analyzed by three FID-type gas chromatographs, Shimadzu GC7A, 12A, and 14A, equipped with integrators. Analyses for methanol and dimethyl ether, C1-C4 hydrocarbons, gasoline range hydrocarbons, and COx were carried out by using columns propark T, VX-10, silicon OV-101, and activated carbon, respectively. The deposited coke was determined by combustion using a micro- thermogravimetric analyzer Shimadzu DT-40. 3. Results and discussion 3.1.

The values of crystallinity for Cats. 2 and 6 were much lower than others, and this feature agreed with the values of BET-surface area. In Fig. 3, the morphologies of Cats. 1-6 observed by SEM are shown. Cubic crystallites of Cat. 5 show a uniform size distribution of 0.8~0.9 pm and almost no amorphous part is observed. On the other hand, Cat. 1, on which no treatment was conducted, and Cat. 6, in which the amount of seed crystals added was 2.5 times of that for Cat. 6, gave larger crystallites and their distribution was broad. Cat. 2, to which no seed crystals were added and the ultrasonic wave treatment was done for a short period, gave a low crystallinity; the sizes seemed to be very small. This was due to the existence of an amorphous phase. The fact that the contents of P and Si in Cats. 2 and 6 are much less than in other catalysts (Table 3) agrees with the tendency mentioned above. In Fig. 4, temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) profiles are compared for the six catalysts in as-synthesized state, i.e. containing the organic tem- plate. Since the catalyst samples have low crystal- linities, Cats. 2 and 6 had a rather large peak, at a lower temperature range around 250. On the other hand, catalyst samples having high crystallinities such as Cats. 3-5 had a very small peak at the same tempera- ture range. The peaks of this temperature range cor- respond to the desorption or combustion of TEAOH involving the amorphous phase. High temperature peaks around 450 correspond to the combustion of the template incorporated crystalline domain. The high temperature peak of Cat. 5 was very sharp, and was shown at the highest temperature side, indicating that the template was incorporated most steadily into the crystallites. Tables 1 and 2 and Figs. 3 and 4 indicate that the addition of the seed crystals to the mixed gel is most effective when the seed crystals are added in an appropriate concentration, as is the case for Cats. 4 and 5, as has been observed by our previous studies [11,23]. Therefore, in the case of Cat, 6, the causes of the failure in the crystallization would be ascribed to the use of an excess amount of seed crystals. In Fig. 5, NH3-TPD profiles for four typical kinds of catalysts are shown. These profiles consist of two peaks: one appears at a low temperature range around 216 Table 3 Physical properties of Cats. 1--6 T. Inui, M.

The low and high tempera- ture peaks correspond to the weak and strong acid sites, respectively. The low temperature peak of Cat. 5 somewhat lowered; however, the strong acid sites corresponding to the high temperature peaks were still stronger than that the catalyst which had exerted the 88% ethylene selectivity [8,21]. The total amount of acid sites measured by NH3- TPD, the amount of acid sites located on the external surfaces of the crystals measured by 4-methylquino- line-TPD, and its difference, i.e., the amount of acid sites located on the internal surfaces of the crystals were calculated on the basis of BET-surface area; values are listed in Table 3. As for the profiles of Cat. 1, the weak acid sites are large, and this feature coincides with that of SAPO-34 [8]; however, the coordination state of Ni in this catalyst as observed by UV-VIS measurements was octahedral, which appeared at both 400 and 750 nm [26]. This indicates that the Ni which exists in Cat. 1 is not incorporated into the framework, but is in an amorphous phase. On the other hand, in other catalysts Cats. 2~ showed a tetrahedral spectra at 635 and 580 nm [27] in UV-VIS, indicating the incorporation of Ni into the framework of SAPO-34. In conclusion, the preparation procedure for Cat. 5, shown in Fig. 1, gives Ni-SAPO-34 crystals having the high crystallinity with uniform size distribution; incorporation of the ingredients is sure. However, there is still room to improve in decreasing the number of strong acid sites and attaining a more uniform incorporation of Ni into the framework of SAPO-34 structure. 3.2. Catalytic performance of the catalysts prepared by different methods In Fig. 6, conversion of methanol and selectivity to ethylene on the six kinds of catalyst are shown as a function of reaction temperature. Cat. 1 which has the largest acid amount showed a total conversion of methanol at lower temperature, even at 300; how- ever, ethylene selectivity was low and it markedly decreased above 500. Cats. 4 and 5 gave higher ethylene selectivities and at 400-450 the value was maintained at a 80% level. Even above that tempera- ture, the degree of decrease was much less than that of Cat. 1. In Fig. 7, results of the duration test are shown. Cat. 5 showed no change in either conversion of methanol or selectivity to ethylene, maintaining its high selec- tivity to ethylene around 87-85%, although on other catalysts it decreased considerably. In Table 4, results of methanol conversion on the six catalysts under the same reaction conditions are sum- marized. Evidently, on Cat. 5 the selectivity to ethyl- ene is the highest and the amount of coke deposited is lowest among the six catalysts. This coincides with the fact that no change of performance appears in the Z lnui, M. Kang/Applied Catalysis A: General 164 (1997) 211-223 217 i rl ~d .a ~d Fig. 3. SEM photographs of Cats. 1-6. duration test shown in Fig. 7. The formation of methane is still great, compared with the amount of methanol conversion on the Ni-SAPO-34 in our pre- vious studies [8,21], and on other metallosilicates [16]. The cause of methane formation is considered to be that methanol is decomposed into hydrogen and carbon monoxide on the Ni part which existed outside the framework of the catalysts and/or in amorphous phase, and those gases react in order to form methane on the same Ni part. 3.3. Correlationships between acidic properties of catalyst and the catalytic perfonnance. The first step of methanol to hydrocarbon conver- sion on the acid catalyst is dehydration from methanol. It first forms dimethylether, and then forms ethylene on further dehydration. The formed ethylene then reacts with the methyl cation which comes from methanol or dimethylether and produces propylene. Thus, the stepwise methylation of light olefins occurs 218 T. lnui, M.

However, by means of Ni-incorporation into the framework of SAPO-34, its acid strength is reduced to an appropriate level to produce mainly ethylene. In fact, as shown in Fig. 8, the acid density correlates to ethylene selectivity except for Cat. 2. Because Cat. 2 has a low crystallinity and its morphology seems to be amorphous, owing to lack of the use of seed crystals and too short ultrasonic wave treatment compared with Cat. 6, which has the same degree of crystallinity as Cat. 2 but a clearly cubic crystalline morphology. Therefore, Cat. 2 should be omitted in examining the correlationships. It is noteworthy that, from extrapola- tion of this linear relationship toward the weaker acid densities, more higher ethylene selectivity would be anticipated. Furthermore, when the size of crystallites is small and the size distribution is sharp, especially as the case of Cat. 5, these factors contribute to make the residence time of reactants inside the crystal- lites during the reaction uniform. The ethylene formed is released from the catalyst before advancing the 220 T. lnui, M.

In practice, methanation occurred as a side reaction owing to the existence of the Ni oxide outside the crystal frameworks and reduced ethylene selectivity to some extent. Further improvement in the decrease of the methane formation would be expected by selective incorporation of Ni into the framework and/or by inhibition of the catalytic function on the free Ni part by appropriate chemical treatments. On zeolite chabazite, serious coke formation occurs not only on the external surface of the crystals but also on the surface of the large cavity inside the crystal. Although Ni-SAPO-34 has the same pore structure as chabazite, much less coke formation occurs on this catalyst is than on the chabazite. The main reason is its weak acidity. As a result, the deactivation observed on the catalysts of the present study, would be attributed to the coke deposition which occurred on the external surface of the crystals, where there are no space-restrictions to growth of bulky aromatic coke. In fact, as shown in Fig. 9, the amount of deposited coke sensitively relates to the acid density of the external surface T. Inui, M.

The catalyst had an acid density of internal surface 4 lamol/ m2 and a low acid density of external surface; it gave a 86% selectivity to ethylene in methanol conversion at 425, without deactivation for at least 11 h on stream. The acid density of internal surface of less than 4 ~tmol/m2 is anticipated to exert more selective formation of ethylene from methanol. This is derived from the extrapolation of the linear correlationship between the acid density and the selectivity to ethylene.

Tel.: +81 75 7535682; fax: +81 75 7717285 A reliable synthetic procedure of Ni-SAPO-34 crystals having the catalytic performance for methanol to ethylene with a selectivity as high as 88% was investigated. The focus of the study was put on the increase in homogeneity of the mixed gel as the precursor of crystallites. Proper treatments of the mixed gel such as application of ultrasonic waves, addition of a proper amount of the seed crystals and milling were found to be important to obtain a high crystallinity and a sharp distribution of crystal size. Incorporations of the crystal ingredients, P, Si, and Ni, into the framework of SAPO-34 were observed for those crystallites. The crystallites, which were 0.85±0.05μm in size and had a solid acid density 4 μmol/m2 distributed inside the crystallites, exhibited the highest ethylene selectivity, 88%. The total conversion level of methanol was observed at a medium reaction temperature around 425°C. These crystallites exhibited a minor deactivation due to the lower amounts of coke formation.
