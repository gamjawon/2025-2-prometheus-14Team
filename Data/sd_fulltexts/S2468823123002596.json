Atomically-dispersed transition-metal nitrogen–carbon catalysts with specific coordination structures are promising cheap candidates for efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in metal–air and fuel cells. Nevertheless, a large part of internal active sites in this class of catalysts cannot really take effect, and the density of surface active sites is seriously insufficient. Here, a reasonable surface-host stepwise method involving adsorption and pyrolysis was designed to prepare Co–Nx/CNC electrocatalysts with highly-dispersed surface active sites, and to stabilize the isolated atomically dispersed Co–NX sites on the surface of graphitized N-doped carbon (NC). The new catalysts achieved admirable ORR activity with half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.88 V under alkalinity. Moreover, Co–Nx/CNC showed stronger four-electron transfer ability and much higher stability. The main reason was that the coordination environment and density of active sites were effectively optimized, enabling the improvement of surface active sites and reactivity. This work provides a general approach to design and prepare highly-stabilized and abundant atomically-dispersed surface active sites for production in electrochemical energy devices.

The key to the high-performance of zinc air batteries lies in the design of robust electrocatalysts to accelerate dynamic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) processes, such design determines energy conversion and storage efficiency, but the dynamics are very slow. Although high-efficiency materials based on precious metals (e.g. Pt and Ir) are reportedly highly-active ORR or oxygen evolution reaction catalysts, their large-scale practical applications as zinc air batteries are hampered by high costs and low stability [5,6]. The atomically-dispersed transition-metal nitrogen complex carbon (M–N–C) is widely studied and considered to be the most promising non-noble-metal replacement of commercial Pt/C, owing to its lower cost, higher electrical conductivity, richer active sites and higher oxygen activation capacity [7–13]. Especially, the Co–N–C formed by pyrolysis of carbon, nitrogen precursors, metal salts and carbon carriers is a promising substitute catalyst of Fe–N–C. This is because the peroxides in the electrode generate free radicals during Fenton reaction, which subjects organic ionomers and membranes to serious degradation [14–17]. Direct pyrolysis of metal-containing precursors with a ZIF structure (ZIF-67) is a common and effective way to prepare Co–N–C catalytic materials. However, the uncontrollability of uneven heat and mass transfer during heat treatment generally leads to the formation of unstable metal compounds attached to or sealed in graphite carbon shells [18]. Furthermore, the loss of lattice order in the carbon carrier and the deterioration of the pore structure easily induce carbon oxidation and corrosion, which are pivotal in the oxygen reduction process [19–22]. These shortcomings will cause severe resistance against charge and mass transport, which is inconducive to reaction progression. In fact, the internal active sites of a catalyst are often limited by insufficient contact and cannot fully play a catalytic role. While, the surface active sites have the advantage of being fully exposed compared to nanoparticles or single atoms that are encapsulated inside, making it easier to contact the reactants and exert a catalytic effect. Thus, the density of surface active sites is an important factor affecting the catalytic activity and determining the catalytic efficiency [23–26]. At present, many studies focus on the construction of multiple active sites with synergistic effects and the preparation of catalysts with excellent pore properties to promote mass transfer in the catalytic process [27–29]. However, studies on the construction of catalysts with surface active sites are still rare and need further expansion. For these reasons, efforts have been made to boost intrinsic activity by engaging more active atomically-dispersed M-Nx at surfaces, which is expected to significantly facilitate the reaction and inhibit 2-electron transfer in the ORR [30–32]. Such modification helps to increase the binding energy of oxygen and the active center, thus improving ORR activity and stability. In this study, more reactive sites with high intrinsic activity were constructed on the surface of carbon frameworks by using an adsorption and pyrolysis strategy, and thereby Co–Nx/CNC electrocatalysts were synthesized (Fig. 1 ). The N-doped carbon (NC) with intenser graphitization used to adsorb CoPc was prepared by direct calcination of ZIF-8 at 1000 °C. Then high-density surface Co–Nx active sites were constructed through pyrolysis of CoPc-NC. The framework can fix and protect individual metal atoms, because the unique hydrocarbon structure reduces fluidity and avoids aggregation of metal active sites. The atomically-dispersed Co–Nx/CNC electrocatalysts with denser surface Co–Nx active sites can greatly facilitate the mass transfer to enhance ORR performance. We believe this work will provide new options for the development of low-cost and high-performance non-PGM single-atom electrocatalysts, particularly M–N–C catalysts. 2 Results and discussion Element composition, morphology and microstructures of the samples were investigated profoundly by HRTEM and HAADF-STEM. CoPc-NC was prepared from CoPc adsorption, high-temperature calcination, pickling and secondary annealing. The Co–NX/CNC catalysts basically retained the dodecahedral structure in diameter of 400 nm, without any observable metal nanocluster or particle (Fig. 2 a-c and Fig. S2a), which illustrates the formation of a highly-disperse Co–Nx coordinated structure. The Co–NC obtained by direct calcination of ZIF-67(Fig. S1) showed large agglomerated nanoparticles encapsulated in NC. In addition, Co distribution in Co–NX/CNC was investigated via HAADF-STEM. Abundant bright spots were observed scattered in the carbon skeleton (in diameter of 1.2–1.3 Å) in a single-atom size instead of small Co clusters, which is ascribed to the isolate atomically-dispersed Co atoms in the samples (Fig. 2h and Fig. S2b). Elemental mapping in Fig. 2d–g demonstrates the Co–Nx/CNC catalysts comprise Co, N and C elements that are homogeneously dispersed. NC and Co–Nx/CN-C are characteristic of type IV nitrogen adsorption & desorption isotherms, suggesting the generation of mesopores and microspores (Fig. 3 a), which are beneficial for rapid electron migration and mass transfer [33]. Based on the isotherms, the specific surface areas of Co-Nx/CNC were computed to be 928 m2·g−1, indicating Co–Nx/CNC provided more reactive sites and maintained high surface reactivity. All the catalysts were analyzed by Raman spectroscopy under the same conditions (Fig. 3b) to clarify the impact of step pyrolysis on the graphitization degree of carbon materials. Based on the Raman peaks at 1594 cm−1 (G band) and1355 cm−1 (D band), the intensity ratio (ID/IG ) of Co–Nx/CNC and NC is 1.01 and 1.02, respectively, indicating the two catalysts both contain graphitic carbon and have nearly identical defect structures of carbon nanosheets [34,35]. The results also indicate the graphitization degree and structure changes of carbon are not apparent after secondary pyrolysis. The relatively low doping of Co does not obviously affect the graphitizing degree of the carbon matrix. The XRD patterns uncovering the crystalline structures of NC and Co–Nx/CNC all show two wide peaks around 43.7° and 24.5° (Fig. 3c), which represent the (100) and (002) planes of graphite carbon respectively [22]. XPS spectra that test chemical states well uncover N, C and Co elements in Co–Nx/CNC (Fig. S3 and Fig. 3d-f). The high-resolution C 1s spectrum of Co–Nx/CNC exhibits four peaks at 284.8 eV (sp2 carbon), 286.1 eV (CN), 287.6 eV (CO), and 290.2 eV (CO) (Fig. 3d) [36,37]. The peak at 284.8 eV illustrates the formation of high-quality conjugated honeycomb lattices. The pyridinic N species is beneficial for electrocatalytic performance [38]. The high-resolution N 1s spectrum of Co–Nx/CNC (Fig. 3e) is separated into five peaks at 398.2, 400.3, 401.2, 402.7 and 399.2 eV, which stand for pyridinic, pyrrolic, graphitic, oxidized N, and Co–Nx respectively [39–42]. The Co 2p spectrum (Fig. 3f) shows the main spin–orbit splitting at 780.8 and 796.1 eV, along with two distinct satellites peaks (786.9 and 804.5 eV), the presence of Co2+ and Co3+ oxidized Co species was confirmed. Specifically, the energy peaks located at 795.2 and 779.7 eV can be attributed to the Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2 of Co3+ in Co–Nx/CNC, while the peaks around 782.3 and 798.1 eV, in line with the characteristic peaks of Co2+ 2p3/2 and Co2+ 2p1/2, respectively [17,43,44]. Electrocatalytic activity of Co–Nx/CNC for ORR was surveyed relative to Pt/C (20%) to further demonstrate the advantages of the step pyrolysis strategy in enriching surface active sites. Fig. 4 a–b shows the ORR activity (LSV curve at 1600 RPM) of Co–Nx/CNC, Co–NC and commercial Pt/C. Co–Nx/CNC shows an onset potential (Eon) of 1.08 V and a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.86 V. These values are close to the Eon = 1.04 V and E1/2 = 0.88 V of Pt/C and higher than the Eon = 1.02 V and E1/2 = 0.84 V of Co–NC, and are comparable to or even higher than the data of many reported ORR catalysts. One of the main reasons for the low ORR ability of electrocatalysts can be the accumulation and insufficient exposure of active sites and their participation in the reaction. The results of LSV suggest that such an adsorption and pyrolysis strategy helps the catalysts to acquire high-density active sites. Fig. 4c displays the polarization curves of Co–Nx/CNC at varying rotating speeds. Obviously, the limiting current climbs linearly with the rise of the rotation speed, while Eon remains unchanged. The ORR kinetics was further tested using the Koutecky–Levich (K–L) method. The plots of Co–NX/CNC show high linearity within 0.6 − 0.4 V, which reveals a first-order reaction kinetics in the oxygen reduction (inset in Fig. 4c). The average n of Co–NX/CNC is about 3.9, proving the ORR mainly follows a four-electron pathway. In addition, the Tafel slopes of Co–Nx/CNC, Co-NC and Pt/C are 105.9, 164.8 and 137.1 mV·dec−1, respectively, manifesting the faster electron transfer rate than that of Pt/C in ORR (Fig. 4d). Additionally, the stability of Co–NX/CNC was tested through potential cycling. Co–NX/CNC lost only 6 mV after 5000 cycles of E1/2, which contributed to robust stability (Fig. 4e). The H2O2 yield and n were measured using RRDE (Fig. 4f) to further confirm the four-electron mechanism during ORR. Experimental results show that n is close to 3.85. Obviously, the H2O2 yield of Co–NX/CNC is lower than 4%, which is significantly reduced from that of the original Co–NC and indicates more four-electron selectivity. DFT calculations were performed to deeply understand the ORR catalytic mechanism. The free energy diagram about the four-electron ORR pathway of Co–Nx/CNC in an alkaline electrolyte in Fig. 5 a displays the free energy change of each ORR step at zero potential (U = 0 V vs. RHE) and balanced potential (U = 1.23 V vs. RHE). For the Co–Nx/CNC at U = 0 V, the first four electron-transfer steps are all downhill, suggesting the nature of all exothermic steps and a facile reaction. Moreover, the absolute value of free energy variation in step one (|∆G1|=0.23 eV, O2 + H2O + e− + *→*OOH + OH−) is the lowest, suggesting this step is rate-deciding and mainly accounts for the ORR. Besides, the first elementary steps are endothermic (energy uphill) and thermodynamically unfavorable at U = 1.23 V, indicating the oxygen adsorption onto Co–N4 is very important for ORR. From the discussion above, an increase in the density of surface active centers can significantly improve oxygen adsorption and greatly promote the rate-determining step, thus increasing the catalytic activity. Fig. 5b shows the ORR pathway model for Co–Nx/CNC by absorbing each intermediate species to boost the reaction. 3 Conclusions A reasonable stepwise strategy involving adsorption and pyrolysis was put forward to build atomically-dispersed Co–NX sites atop the highly-graphitized NC. This surface-host stepwise method can inhibit agglomeration and improve dispersity and the density of surface active sites in comparison with direct calcination. The N-doped carbon prepared by pyrolysis at 1000 °C possesses strong anti-corrosion capability. The electrochemical results indicate that the Co–NX/CNC eletrocatalysts have thrilling activity in alkaline media and excellent stability for ORR. This work offers a new strategy to design atomically-dispersed surface active sites catalysts with a specific coordination environment for sustainable energy conversion.

        "dc:description": "Atomically-dispersed transition-metal nitrogen–carbon catalysts with specific coordination structures are promising cheap candidates for efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in metal–air and fuel cells. Nevertheless, a large part of internal active sites in this class of catalysts cannot really take effect, and the density of surface active sites is seriously insufficient. Here, a reasonable surface-host stepwise method involving adsorption and pyrolysis was designed to prepare Co–Nx/CNC electrocatalysts with highly-dispersed surface active sites, and to stabilize the isolated atomically dispersed Co–NX sites on the surface of graphitized N-doped carbon (NC). The new catalysts achieved admirable ORR activity with half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.88 V under alkalinity. Moreover, Co–Nx/CNC showed stronger four-electron transfer ability and much higher stability. The main reason was that the coordination environment and density of active sites were effectively optimized, enabling the improvement of surface active sites and reactivity. This work provides a general approach to design and prepare highly-stabilized and abundant atomically-dispersed surface active sites for production in electrochemical energy devices.",
