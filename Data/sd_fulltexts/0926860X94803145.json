Introduction Problems of selectivity are of primary importance for the optimal design and performance of many catalytic processes. In the literature many works are found devoted to different aspects of selectivity, including its relation with diffusion effects, as well as the selectivity alterations caused by coke formation. Yet, little attention has been paid to the joint influence of mass transfer and deactivation on the selectivity of complex reactions. The necessity of examining the interrelation between catalyst deactivation and intraparticle resistance is noted in a number of studies, among which we shall mention refs. [ 1-5]. Some peculiarities of the influence of diffusion on deactivation are discussed in our previous works [6-8]. *Corresponding author. E-mail BANCHEM@BGEARN.BITNET, fax.

Kumbilieva et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 118 (1994) 199-215 The point is that the blockage of active catalyst sites may follow different kinetics under conditions of intraparticle resistance. The character of possible diffusion- caused alteration in the deactivation kinetics should be interrelated with the process mechanism. From the standpoints of kinetics, the problem may be associated with the functional dependence of deactivation on conversion. Similar considerations are of importance when the theoretical analysis of reactions accompanied by catalyst deactivation involves the selectivity problems. In this study, we shall extend the approach developed in refs. [ 9-11 ] about some selectivity problems. 2. Models of reaction mechanisms It is hardly possible to consider the whole variety of reaction schemes for complex processes accompanied by catalyst deactivation. In the present study, we shall focus on several comparatively simple models which take into account different mecha- nisms of formation of the main and side products, on the one hand, and the coke precursors, on the other. We shall assume that: (i) the side product is harmless regarding the catalyst activity; (ii) the rates of the reaction steps responsible for the formation of the desired and the side products are of the same scale; (iii) the deactivation reaction is supposed to be a constituent part of the process as a whole. Within the frames of these assumptions, we shall seek to model the interrelation of the reaction mechanism with the selectivity and deactivation kinetics in the absence and presence of diffusion limitations. As a first approximation, let us take the general scheme: A+ Z >[lz] (PZ) k2 k3 > B+ Z > D + Z >coke where A denotes the initial reactants, B the desired product, D the side products, (PZ) the coke precursors; and Z a free catalyst site; [IZ] stands for catalyst sites occupied by surface intermediates. Different mechanisms for the formation of each of the products may be realized. In general, it is necessary to consider that the side products and/or the coke precursors often come to existence as a result of the interaction between surface intermediates and reactants from the gas phase. In this connection, we shall specify three provisional mechanism types with account for the formation of side products: K. Kumbilieva et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 118 (1994) 199-215 201 Type I: k2 kl / > B + Z A + Z ~- >[IZ] , (I) k3 ... >D+ Z This scheme we shall conditionally call 'fork selectivity type'. It models the case when the adsorbates undergo a consequence of surface transformations, in the course of which two branching routes arise. Type II: kl k2 A+Z , [IZ] , B+Z (2) k3 A+ [IZ]s , D+Z where [IZ]s stands for the intermediate responsible for the formation of the side product. The formation of the desired and the side product is realized as if through competing interactions of the initial species with free catalyst sites or some of the intermediates, respectively. This scheme we shall conditionally call 'competitive- parallel selectivity type'. Type III: kl k2 A+Z , [IZ] , B+Z (3) k3 B+ [IZ]s ~ D+Z This mechanism scheme we call 'consecutive selectivity type'. Here, the side product comes into existance as a result of the interaction of some surface inter- mediate, [IZ] s, with the molecules of the main product desorbed into the gas phase. Any of these three considered schemes of conversion of A into B or D, may be accompanied by deterioration of the catalyst activity. We shall submit for consid- eration the case when the catalyst deactivation is caused by coke formation. In agreement with the idea that the coke precursors usually arise as a result of the interaction of either free catalyst sites or some surface intermediates, noted as [ IZ] p, with molecules from the gas phase, the following probable mechanisms may be distinguished: A+ [IZ]p ~ (PZ) ~coke B + [IZ]p ~ (PZ) ~ coke D+ [IZ]p -\"* (PZ) ~coke B+Z~ (PZ) ~coke D+ Z--* (PZ) ~coke (4a) (4b) (4c) (4d) (4e) Naturally, the coke formation mechanism often includes various combinations of the stated steps. For the sake of clarity, we shall reduce the more complicated 202 K. Kumbilieva et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 118 (1994) 199-215 mechanisms to simple terms, considering just the routes with the most appreciable contribution to poison depositions. By coupling schemes ( 1 ), (2) or (3) with each of the postulated mechanisms (4a-4e) for the formation of coke precursors, we come to a variety of probable types of complex reactions, summarized in Tables 1-3. The proposed schemes correspond to feasible types of catalytic processes accompanied by deactivation, such as isomerization, cracking, dehydrogenation, dehydrocyclization, decarbonylation, total oxidation, etc. For example, scheme (4) in Table 1 corresponds to the scheme assumed by Vygdorovich et al. [ 12] for the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene on nickel catalysts; schemes (5) and (10) corre- spond to the mechanism postulated in ref. [ 13 ] for the dehydrogenation of isoa- mylenes accompanied by both cracking and coke formation on commercial phosphate catalysts; scheme ( 11 ) corresponds to the mechanism of dehydrogena- tion of isoamylenes on a zinc-chromia catalyst [ 14]. The proceeding of each of the considered model reactions was simulated to occur in an open system in the absence and in the presence of intraparticle resistance. The only factor determining the region of control was supposed to be the size of the catalyst pellets. 3. Kinetic descriptions On deriving the kinetic equations for the rates of the reactions in the absence of diffusion restrictions, the quasistationary approximation [ 15 ] in an ideal adsorbed layer is assumed. For the sake of simplicity, the elementary steps are assumed to be irreversible, and the step stoichiometric numbers equal to unity. As about the deactivation kinetics, it is supposed that the rate limiting step is the formation of coke precursors. The deactivation rate is modelled to be one magnitude lower than the rate of the basic process. On these assumptions, we derive the expressions describing the rate RA of the conversion of the initial reagents A, rate ra of formation of the desired product B, rate ro of formation the side product, as well as the deactivation rate G, in terms of the total conversion x, and the conversion into desired product Y. The selectivity S is defined as the ratio rA/ra [9]. The kinetic equations characterizing each of the postulated reaction schemes are presented in Tables 1-3. The coefficients K1, K3, K4 which appear in the expressions, are dimensionless ratios of the step rate constant k2, to the step rate coefficients, denoted in the schemes as kx. k3 and k4, correspond- ingly. The expressions for the rate of processes affected by diffusion resistance are derived in accordance with the formula of Pshezhetsky-Rubinstein [ 16], which correlates the reaction rate under diffusion control with the intrinsic reaction rate. On representing the rates as functions of conversion, the relation can be written as: K. Kumbilieva et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 118 (1994) 199-215 203 r* (x)- ~/2De--------Yf r(x) dx) Rp (5) By xo and Xs is denoted the conversion in the centre and on the surface of the catalyst pellet, respectively, Rp is the ratio of the pellet volume to its external surface, Def is a diffusion coefficient. The asterisk superscripts denote the variables relevant to the diffusion region. In compliance with the various expressions for r(x) describing the intrinsic kinetics of particular reactions, the corresponding equations for the reaction rates in the diffusion region engage integrands of different form, described in the proper place. 4. Analysis of the influence of conversion on selectivity The analysis of the dependence of the selectivity functions on the conversion may provide interesting information about the behaviour of the system in the course of deactivation (i.e., drop of conversion). It appears to us that some of the consid- erations may further be applied for the optimal design of some processes, and we shall discuss them in more detail. 4.1. Reaction schemes following the Fork Selectivity mechanism (Type I) The reaction schemes considered, together with the corresponding kinetic descriptions of selectivity are presented in Table 1. Scheme { 1 } in the table cor- responds to this type of reactions in the absence of deactivation; schemes { 2 }-{ 6 } model the process accompanied by coke formation, for different ways of forming the coke precursors.

( ) kinetic region; ( .... ) region of diffusion restrictions. It is evident from the form of the selectivity equations, that processes following mechanisms of 'fork selectivity' type, behave as 'isokinetic' [ 9] both in the absence of deactivation and in case the coke precursors are formed as a result of the interaction of the side product with surface intermediates or free catalyst sites (schemes { 2 } and { 3 } ). The latter schemes coincide in fact with the mechanism of series coke formation. In case the coke precursors arise from the interaction of the initial species with surface intermediates, (scheme 4), it follows from the selectivity function that S should slightly decrease with the drop of conversion. As regards the case when coke precursors come into existence after the interaction of the desired product with either free catalyst sites or sites occupied by intermediates catalyst sites (schemes { 5 } and { 6 } ), the indications are that the selectivity should increase in the course of deactivation. Therefore, the step mechanism of coke formation influences in one or another way the character of selectivity changes with the drop of conversion. One can get a more clear notion how appreciable may become such changes under actual operation conditions, by examining the calculated curves of selectivity versus conversion, which we call henceforth 'selectivity-conversion curves'. These curves have their specificity for the different reaction schemes. The plots in Fig. 1 illustrate the selectivity-conversion curves corresponding to proceeding of reactions mod- elled by schemes { 4 } and { 6 }. The solid lines on all the plots refer to processes realized in diffusion-free, while the dashed ones refer to processes occurring in diffusion-influenced reaction systems. The curves presented are calculated for val- ues of the parameters K1 =0.1, K3 = 1.0, K4= 10.0. Curves calculated for other feasible values of these parameters differ insignificantly from the presented ones. On comparing the curves, one can conclud~ that when the coke precursors arise on catalyst sites occupied by intermediates, the selectivity remains in fact hardly influenced by the extent of conversion. The catalytic system seems to be more sensitive to the drop of conversion for the case of scheme { 6 }, when the subsequent contacts of the molecules of the desired product with free catalyst sites may lead to the formation of coke precursors. In contrast to scheme {4}, the selectivity is expected to raise in the course of deactivation (curves 3 and 4 in Fig. 1 ). 206 K.

( ) kinetic region; ( .... ) region of diffusion restrictions. For all the models examined, the kinetic analysis predicts higher values of selectivity for the process realized under conditions of diffusion resistance. In this connection, it is reasonable to analyse the evolution of the catalytic systems modeled in terms of the dimensionless time, ~-, and to compare the dynamics of the variables Y and Y*, standing for the extents of conversion into desired product in the absence and presence of intraparticle resistance, respectively. The effects of diffusion retardations on the rate of processes accompanied by catalyst deactivation may be two-edged. As is generally known, the intraparticle resistance delays the reaction rate, and as a result a lower total conversion is attained in the beginning. At the same time, the diffusion restrictions may also lead to a decrease in the rate of coke formation. The superposition of these two effects may lead to their mutual compensation. It was shown in refs. [6-8] that under certain conditions the process may reach a point where the effective rate of the reaction exposed to diffusion resistance will even exceed the reaction rate in the kinetic region. The problem appears still more complicated when the selectivity effects should be considered in addition. Reactions following schemes { 2 }-{6} are expected to exert higher selectivity under diffusion control, and the selectivity remains practi- cally unchanged in the course of deactivation. Hence, if this effect superimposes with the joint effects of mass transfer and deactivation, it will reflect on the yield of the desired product. In view of this it would be of interest to study the time dependence of Y and Y* compared to the time dependence of the total conversion x and x* The plots in Fig. 2 show the curves of total conversion ( 1 and 2) and of conver- sion into desired products (curves 3 and 4) versus dimensionless time ~-calculated for a model reaction proceeding after scheme { 2 }. The analogous curves calculated with respect to other deactivation mechanisms differ very slightly from those presented. It can be seen from the plots that after a certain time interval, the total conversion attained by the diffusion-limited reaction system, comes to exceed the total conversion in the kinetic region. As a result, regardless of the initial diffusion- caused retardation of the reaction rate, it may be expected that moderate intraparticle resistance may reduce the deteriorative influence of coke formation on the apparent K. Kumbilieva et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 118 (1994) 199-215 207 catalyst activity. Therefore, the realization of the process on catalyst grains of size provoking moderate diffusion resistance may turn out advantageous in view of long-term rate of conversion. As about selectivity, the indications from the kinetic analysis are that it should be higher under diffusion control and change insignifi- cantly in the course of deactivation. In consequence, the conversion into desired products Y* attained in the presence of intraparticle restrictions will come to exceed the 'useful' conversion Yattained in their absence even within a shorter time interval than the time characterizing the intersection of the total conversion curves. Such an expectation may be an additional argument in favour of realizing the process on catalyst grains of larger size, in case it does not run counter to the other consider- ations for the optimal process design. For reactions modelled by scheme {4 }, when the initial reactants participate in the formation of coke precursors, the selectivity should slightly decrease in the course of deactivation. For reactions modelled by schemes {5} and {6}, when the desorbed molecules of the desired product are responsible for the creation of coke precursors, the indications are that selectivity should weakly increase in the course of deactivation. However, the influence of conversion on selectivity for the consid- ered domain of parameter values is so slight, that the calculated curves for the conversion changes with time differ insignificantly from the curves corresponding to schemes { 2 } and { 3 }. 4.2. Reaction schemes following the Competitive-Parallel Selectivity mechanism (Type II) Schematically, this type of reactions in the absence of deactivation is described by scheme { 7 } in Table 2. The intermediates formed from the interaction of the initial species with the catalyst surface, undergo a sequence of surface transfor- mations, to bring to existance the main product B. The side product is supposed to arise in result of the competing interactions of some of the intermediates, [IZ]s, with the initial reactants from the gas phase. The kinetic and mechanism pecularities of this type of reaction schemes are presented in Table 2 (schemes {7-11 } ). The variables/x2 and 02 in the expressions for the S* functions denote the solutions of the following integral equations: I ( 1 -x)xdx K1 + K1/K3 + 1 - (1 + K1/K3)x ~2~ xs 3ts ~2~ xs xs (1 -x)dx K1 + K1/K3 + 1 - (1 + K1/K3)~ xdx K1 + K1/K3 + 1 - ( 1 + K1/K3)x (1 -x)dx K1 + K1/K3 + 1 - (1 + K1/K3)x (8) (9) 208 K.

( ) kinetic region; ( .... ) region of diffusion restrictions. It is evident from the formula that selectivity as a rule is influenced by the extent of conversion. For values of K3 comparable to unity (which is quite feasible within the frame of the assumptions stated), selectivity should exert lower values for lower extent of conversion. The analysis of the theoretical selectivity-conversion curves, presented in Fig. 3 indicates that the decrease of selectivity with conversion should be more appreciable in the kinetic region, and less considerable in the region of intraparticle resistance. In case the reaction is accompanied by coke formation, the process is supposed to follow one of the schemes {8}-{11 } from Table 2. According to the kinetic predictions, the decrease of selectivity with the drop of conversion should be stronger when the molecules of the main product are engaged in the formation of coke precursors (schemes {10} and {11}). The comparison of the calculated selectivity-conversion curves shows, anyhow, that they differ insignificantly for mechanisms of coke formation following schemes { 8 }-{ 10}. The deviation is more noticeable for the case of reaction scheme { 11 }. The values of K4 considered are by the order of 10 (such a value of K4 models the case of 10 times slower rate of coke formation compared to the main reaction rate). The selectivity is expected to exert higher values and to be less influenced by the fall of conversion under conditions of diffusion resistance. The plots in Fig. 3 demonstrate the selectivity- conversion curves corresponding to schemes {8} and {9} (curves 1 and 2), and to scheme { 10}, (curves 3 and 4), for values of K1 =0.1, K3 = 1.0, K4= 10.0. The time variation of x, x*, Y, and Y* calculated for model react:ions corre- sponding to schemes { 8 } or { 9 }, is presented in Fig. 4. The evolution of the curves of total conversion in the absence and presence of diffusion limitations is similar to that characterizing the 'fork selectivity' type. The basic difference is, that for reactions following the 'competitive-parallel'selectivity' type, the drop of conver- sion in the course of deactivation gives rise to a decrease in the selectivity as well. The coinciding changes of selectivity are plotted in the upper panel of Fig. 4. The conversion into desired product Y is proportional to the total conversion, and to selectivity. In the absence of mass transfer restrictions, the total conversion is initially higher, but drops more abruptly with time; on the other hand, the selectivity 210 K.

In the presence of moderate intraparticle resistance, by contrast, initially the total conver- sion is lower, but its decrease is smoother; the selectivity is higher and remains hardly changed in the course of deactivation. In consequence, the yield of B attained under moderate diffusion control, may come to exceed the yield of B obtained under kinetic control, within a shorter time interval than the interval in which the total conversion in the diffusion region becomes higher than the total conversion in the kinetic region. This is demonstrated by the plots in Fig. 4. 4.3. Reaction schemes following the Consecutive Selectivity mechanism (Type III) The reaction scheme { 12 } in Table 3 corresponds to this type of reactions in the absence of deactivation. The side product D comes into existance through inter- actions of surface intermediates with desorbed molecules of the main product B. In this sence, the side reaction may be considered consecutive with respect to the basic one.

The analysis of the conversion-selectivity curves calculated for values of K3 comparable to unity (the plots are presented on Fig. 5 ) indicates that the increase of selectivity with the decrease of conversion is more strongly expressed in the absence of intraparticle resistance. In case the reaction is accompanied by coke formation, the process was assumed to follow one of the schemes { 13}-{ 16} described in Table 3. Schemes { 13} and { 14} model processes in which the coke precursors are formed from the interaction of the side product molecules with surface intermediates or free catalyst sites. The kinetic expressions derived for the selectivity functions of such processes keep the same form as in the absence of deactivation. The form of the selectivity functions is altered when molecules of the initial species or the main product are responsible for the formation of coke precursors (schemes { 15 } and { 16}, respectively). The analysis of the selectivity-conversion curves calculated for reasonable values of the parameters K1, K3 and K4 shows that the curves corresponding to scheme { 15 } practically coincide with the curves corresponding to schemes { 12 }-{ 14}.

( ) kinetic region; ( .... ) region of diffusion restrictions. case of scheme { 16}, when the coke precursors are supposed to arise on the interaction of the main product molecules from the gas phase with free catalyst sites, the deviation of the selectivity-conversion curve is more noticeable (see the plots in Fig. 5). Therefore, the essential point is that for reactions following this type of mecha- nism, the selectivity is expected to increase with the decrease of conversion, and this tendency is more strongly expressed in the absence of diffusion limitations. In this connection, the yield of desired products will be influenced by two opposite factors in the course of deactivation: the delay of the reaction rate, and the increase of selectivity. Both these factors are quite more noticeable in the kinetic region. The more intense raise of the selectivity in the course of the reaction under kinetic control may overcompensate the effect of more intense fall of the total conversion, compared to the region of diffusion control. The plots in Fig. 6 show the selectivity and conversion changes with time for a model reaction following scheme { 16}. Initially, the reaction rate, and the selectivity intrinsic to the diffusion-free reaction system exceed those relevant to the region of diffusion control. As a result, both the total conversion and the conversion into desired products attained in the absence of intraparticle restrictions are higher than those attained in their presence. Further, under the action of deactivation, the total conversion falls quite more abruptly in the kinetic region, and after a certain time mterval becomes even lower than the conversion corresponding to the diffusion region. At the same time, the selectivity characterizing the process under kinetic control, increases appreciably, and at some moment comes to exceed the selectivity of the process under diffusion control. As we noted, the conversion into desired products may be considered proportional to the total conversion, on the one hand, and to the selectivity, on the other. As a 214 K. Kumbilieva et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 118 (1994) 199-215 matter of fact, these two factors undergo conflicting changes in the course of the reaction -- in a quite more apprehensible degree in the absence of diffusion limi- tations, and somehow alleviated in their presence. As a result, the conversion into desired products attained in the kinetic region remains all the time higher than the 'useful' conversion attained under conditions of intraparticle resistance. Hence, it seems more advantageous to realize processes of such type on catalyst grains of smaller size, preventing the diffusion effects. 5. Conclusions The analysis performed draws attention to some problems of the interrelation between the mechanism of complex catalytic processes and their kinetics. Calcu- lations considering the changes in selectivity of processes accompanied by catalyst deactivation indicate that under the action of deactivation, the selectivity may either decrease or increase, depending on the reaction mechanism. The changes are expected to be more appreciable in the absence of intraparticle diffusion resistance. The kinetic prediction may serve practical use with respect of elucidating the resources for reducing the harmful effect of deactivation on the yield of the desired products. In case the process mechanism makes for decrease of the selectivity with the drop of conversion, on the one hand, and the selectivity is higher and remains less affected under diffusion control, on the other, it may appear more advantageous to lead the process on catalyst grains ensuring moderate intraparticle resistance. In case the process mechanism calls forth an increase of the selectivity in the course of deactivation, it is recommended to realize it on small catalyst particles. The results presented refer to model catalytic reactions, including several classes of feasible reaction mechanisms. The authors hope that the stated approach may prove useful for the optimal design of complex processes realized in practice over catalysts accompanied by deactivation. Any arguments brought by empirical obser- vations either in support or at variance with the above conclusions could contribute to a more deep insight into the intimate nature of complicated catalytic reactions. 6.
