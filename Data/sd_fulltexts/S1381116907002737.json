Various new malonate compounds (R1R2C(COOBu)2) with different substituents (R1, R2) were systematically synthesized and investigated for use as an internal donor (ID) in combination with a MgCl2-supported TiCl4 type catalyst, a triethylaluminum (TEA) co-catalyst and an alkoxysilane external donor (ED) for application in propylene polymerization. The catalytic activity and isotacticity of polypropylene (PP) greatly depended on not only the oxygen electron density of the ED, but also on the molecular volume of the ID. Furthermore, the mechanism of the active site formation was discussed with respect to the composition of the catalyst treated with TEA and ED, and with respect to the temperature rising elution fractionation (TREF) results of PP and so on. It was presumed that the desorption of malonates near Ti species from MgCl2 caused the generation of atactic PP sites, and the decrease of the isotacticity of PP. Graphical abstract Propylene polymerization using MgCl2-supported TiCl4 type catalysts with new various malonate compounds (R1R2C(COOBu)2) as internal donors was investigated. The catalytic activity and isotacticity of polypropylene (PP) depended on the molecular volume of the malonates. Furthermore, the mechanism of the active site formation was discussed with the catalyst compositions, the temperature rising elution fractionation curves of PP and so on. Keywords Computer modeling Internal donor Malonate Poly(propylene) (PP) Ziegler-Natta polymerization 1 Introduction In industry, polypropylene (PP) is typically manufactured in the presence of the fourth-generation Ziegler-Natta catalyst. The polymerization catalyst is generally prepared from TiCl4 supported by MgCl2, and accompanied with an internal donor (ID), such as di-n-butylphthlate (DNBP), a co-catalyst, such as triethylaluminum (TEA), and an external donor (ED), such as dicyclopentyldimethoxysilane (DCPS). The molecular structure and performance of the obtained PP are dominantly controlled by ID and ED [1]. Since the discovery of the phthalate system in 1982, the development of ID has been remarkable, for example 1,3-diethers (e.g. 2,2-diisoamyl-1,3-dimethoxypropane) [2], succinates, such as diisobutyl-2,3-diisopropylsuccinate [3], maleates and malonates [4,5]. It was especially shown that the malonate system had comparatively good activity and high isotacticity [6,7]. A great number of basic studies, particularly in understanding the role of ID (mainly phthalate and 1,3-diether), have been carried out [8–16]. Indeed, a number of outstanding models concerning these active species have been shown by Doi et al., Busico et al., Cavallo and co-workers and Terano [17–20]. Here, although a whole myriad of substituents can be introduced into the second carbon and the ester parts of the malonate structure, the effect of the substitution has not been fully studied. Moreover, the mechanistic aspects of malonate having a different molecular structure from phthalate and 1,3-diether have not been reported at all. Namely, it was expected that basic investigations of malonate systems would be very useful to understand the role of ID and the structures of the active species in not only the malonate system but also in other ID systems. In addition, these investigations are expected to bring an improvement in the PP performance (for example, the replacement of ABS and/or PET resin by new PP having extremely high isotacticity and stiffness). Furthermore, malonate compounds, which are neither poisonous nor endocrine disruptors, must be non-toxic and environmentally friendly. In this paper, computer calculation techniques were used to design new malonate compounds with various substituents, and catalysts formed using these malonates were systematically prepared and evaluated. 2 Experimental part 2.1 Materials Propylene, hydrogen, TEA, various EDs (except for 1,1-dimethyl-2-methylpropyl-cyclopentyldimethoxysilane: CPTXS) and DNBP were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. n-Heptane was dried over 4A-molecular sieve. CPTXS was synthesized according to reported methods [21]. 2.2 Synthesis of malonates The new malonate compounds used for this work were synthesized by one of two methods. The first method involved the esterification reaction between malonic acids and alcohol, and the second was the alkylation reaction of malonate with NaH and alkyl halide. The detailed synthetic procedures of malonates, and their corresponding synthetic yields, elemental analyses and 1H NMR spectra are reported here. 2.2.1 Di-n-butyl malonate (BM) Two hundred grams (1.92mol) of malonic acid, 1.05L (11.5mol) of n-BuOH, 770mL of toluene, and 4g (0.022mol) of p-toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH) were mixed together in a three-neck flask fitted with a Dean-Stark trap, and stirred under reflux for 4h until a predetermined quantity of water was produced. Next, after neutralization of the reaction liquid with NaHCO3 (aq), the organic layer was dried with anhydrous Mg2SO4, and the remaining toluene was reduced in volume by atmospheric distillation, and further distilled under reduced pressure to give BM.

Next, 71g (0.500mol) of methyl iodide was added slowly to the solution dropwise, and the mixture stirred under reflux for 2h, to introduce the methyl group (second step). After washing the reaction liquid in NH4Cl (aq), the organic layer was dried with anhydrous Mg2SO4 and the remaining THF reduced by atmospheric distillation, and further distilled under reduced pressure.

Also, this catalyst is called DNBP-Cat. 2.3.2 Malonate catalysts The TiCl4/malonate/MgCl2 type catalysts were prepared using the known method with Mg(OEt)2 as a support material [22]. In addition, these catalysts are called BM-Cat, BMM-Cat, CPCB-Cat, CBCB-Cat, BDMM-Cat, BDEM-Cat, BCPM-Cat and BDBM-Cat, respectively. 2.4 Treatment of solid catalysts Five grams of the solid catalyst including ID and 50mL of n-heptane were introduced into the 300mL-reactor, and the slurry was stirred at 40°C. The solid catalyst was treated by the addition of TEA or TEA/DCPS. After a reaction time, the slurry was immediately filtered and sufficiently washed with heptane. The amounts of ID and ED included in the treated-solid catalysts were determined by GC method. 2.5 Propylene polymerization The polymerization of propylene was carried out in a stainless steel-autoclave reactor. 2.5.1 Bulk polymerization Four hundred millilters propylene was introduced into a 1 L-autoclave cooled at 0°C. After the addition of hydrogen at 1MPa, the temperature was heated to 70°C. Next, 20mL of heptane, 2mmol of TEA, 0.05mmol of DCPS and a solid catalyst (0.001mmol per Ti atom) were introduced into the autoclave, and the bulk polymerization was performed for 60min. The polymerization was stopped by the addition of 10mL of MeOH. The obtained polymer was dried for 2h in vacuo at 80°C [23]. 2.5.2 Slurry polymerization Four hundred millilters of heptane, 2mmol of TEA and a treated-solid catalyst (0.005mmol), which was first reacted with TEA or TEA/ED, were introduced into the 1 L-autoclave dried in vacuo at room temperature. After the addition of propylene, the temperature was heated to 80°C and the polymerization was started. After 60min, the polymerization reaction was quenched by the addition of methanol. The obtained polymer was dried for 2h in vacuo at 80°C [22]. 2.6 TREF measurements Three milligrams of PP dissolved in o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) as a solvent was loaded to the apparatus equipped with a 4.2Φ×150mm-column filled with Cromosolb-PAW® and an IR-detector. The solution was cooled from 135 to 0°C at a constant rate (5°C/h), and the temperature was kept at 0°C for 10min to induce crystallization of PP. Next, the temperature was elevated from 0 to 135°C at 40°C/h and ODCB as a dissolution reagent of crystallized PP (flow rate: 1.0mL/min) was fed into the column. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Effect of malonate substituents as an internal donor Various new malonate compounds (R1R2C(COOBu)2) having different substituents (R1 and R2) were synthesized, and the results of the polymerization of propylene using these catalysts (including these malonates as ID) are shown in Table 1 . Sadashima et al. had already found a good correlation between the 29Si NMR chemical shift of the various organic alkoxysilane compounds as ED and the electron density of oxygen calculated by the MNDO method. The authors had also shown that the electron density of oxygen in ED had been an important factor for controlling the isotacticity of the obtained PP [21]. Therefore, the molecular volume, the electron density of the carbonyl oxygen, and the distance between the two oxygens of the IDs, were calculated using the MNDO method (semi-empirical method, calculated with MOPAC 93®) [24–26]. Fig. 1 (A and B) shows that there was good correlation among the isotacticity of the obtained PP, the catalytic activity and the molecular volume of the malonates. The catalyst including a malonate having an appropriate molecular volume (240–300Å3), such as CPBC, BDMB, CBBC, BDEM and BCPM, showed high isotacticity and high activity. As can be seen from Table 1, the electron density of the oxygen in the malonates was approximately −0.34a.u., which was close to that of DNBP. The distance between the oxygen atoms of the malonates except for CBBC was in the range of 3.5–3.9Å, which was similar to that of DNBP. Therefore, it can be presumed that one of the main factors in determining the performance in this system is the molecular volume of the malonate. Indeed, it is considered that not only the ease of approaching MgCl2 is significant for enhancement of the performance, but also the structure after absorbing MgCl2 may be important. 3.2 Effect of alkoxysilane substituents as an external donor Table 2 shows the comparison results of the polymerization evaluations of DNBP-Cat and BCPM-Cat, which indicated the relatively high isotacticity and activity in Table 1, using various organic alkoxysilane compounds (R1R2Si(OMe)2) having different substituents (R1 and R2) as ED. The molecular volume, the electron density of oxygen, and the distance between the two oxygen atoms of the EDs were calculated by MNDO. The relationship among the electron density of oxygen in the EDs, the isotacticity of PP, and the catalytic activity, are shown in Fig. 2 (A and B), respectively. Consequently, as shown in Fig. 2, using an ED having a large oxygen electron density, the isotacticities and activities of both catalyst systems were increased (the distance between the oxygen atoms was almost constant at 2.6–2.7Å, as shown in Table 2. It seems that the molecular volume mainly contributes to the molecular-weight-distribution control [21].). Furthermore, when the same ED was used, the BCPM system indicated a lower isotacticity than the DNBP system by 2mol%, but when DCPS was used as an ED, the difference in isotacticity between the two systems was reduced to 0.2mol%. Moreover, the activities of both catalyst systems were almost equal, and the maximum values were obtained by the use of DCPS. 3.3 Mechanism of the active site formation In order to clarify the role of the donor, and the mechanism of the active site formation in the BCPM catalyst system, BCPM and DNBP having various donor compositions were prepared, and the resulting TREF data of PP obtained by polymerization using these catalysts, together with their compositions, were tabulated in Table 3 . Here, the conditions of catalyst treatment and polymerization were described in the footnotes of Table 3 and in Section 2. It was expected that only the ID affected the formation of the active species for runs 2 and 9, but both ID and ED contributed to the active species formation for the remaining runs. Moreover, the typical TREF charts (runs 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and 14) are shown in Fig. 3 . Furthermore, the change of donor composition in the course of treatment using TEA/ED (runs 3–7 and 10–14) and the values of the corresponding TREF data are indicated in Fig. 4 . As shown in runs 1, 8 and in Fig. 3(A), the peak temperature of the main fraction of PP obtained by the two catalyst systems was equal at 117°C, whereas compared to the existing DNBP system, the width of the main peak in the BCPM system was broadened to the slightly lower temperature side, and the amount of soluble parts at 0°C (APP) was larger than that of the BCPM system. Consequently, this seems to reflect the results of the slightly lower isotacticity of PP obtained with the BCPM system rather than with the DNBP system (97.5<97.7mol%, Δ[mmmm]: 0.2mol% as shown in Tables 1 and 2). Although there was a large amount of APP and the middle elution temperature fraction (20–115°C) in runs 2, 9 and in Fig. 3(B) on which ED was of no effect, the APP decreased and the high elution temperature fraction (115–135°C) increased in runs 1, 8 and in Fig. 3(A), and runs 3–7, 10–14 and in Fig. 3(C), on which ED was of effect in the polymerization or treatment step in both catalyst systems. Therefore, it turns out that ED has also an important role in improving the isotacticity in the malonate system. In runs 3–7, 10–14 and in Fig. 4(A), the peak temperature of the high elution temperature fraction of both catalyst systems was almost the same (near 117°C). Moreover, in runs 1, 3–7, 8, 10–14 and in Fig. 4(C), the tendency for ID to be extracted by TEA and exchanged with ED in advance of the reaction was well agreed in both systems. Hence, it was expected that this process was essentially similar to the formation of the high-IPP site. In runs 1, 3–7, 8, 10–14 and in Fig. 4(B), the amount of APP became fixed after a gradual reduction in the DNBP system. On the other hand, after reduction for about 20min, the amount of APP increased and became fixed in the BCPM system. Furthermore, in runs 1, 3–7, 8, 10–14 and in Fig. 4(C), while DNBP remained in the catalyst until the end of the reaction, BCPM was completely extracted during the reaction. Therefore, the formation of APP sites in both systems clearly differed from each other, and it was considered that the behavior of malonate mentioned above caused an increase in the amount of APP obtained by the malonate system. 4 Conclusion Propylene (PP) polymerization using TiCl4/malonate/MgCl2 type catalysts with the newly synthesized malonate compounds (R1R2C(COOBu)2) having various substituents as internal donors (IDs) was investigated. The catalysts having a malonate with an appropriate molecular volume indicated high isotacticity and high activity. Moreover, it was suggested that the malonate system formed high-IPP active species through the donor exchange of ID and ED, which was similar to the existing phthalate system. On the other hand, the malonate system produced a relatively large amount of APP and middle-IPP. One of the main causes for the likely formation of the APP site was the desorption of malonates near the Ti species. We will report further investigations considering the selective adsorption nature of ID with respect to the specific faces of MgCl2. References [1] S.
