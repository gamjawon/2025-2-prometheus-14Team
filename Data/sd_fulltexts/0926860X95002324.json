Box 1380, Houston, TX 7725, USA Received 12 June 1995; revised 5 September 1995; accepted 14 September 1995 Abstract Conventional nickel or cobalt modified molybdenum disulfide-containing hydrotreating catalysts are generally prepared by impregnation. While this route has proven to be quite successful and has led to a variety of commercial products, inherent in the pore volume impregnation technique are several potential limitations. These limitations may be chemical or economic in nature. In order to overcome these potential limitations, we have developed a new, one-step route to the oxidic form of these nickel or cobalt modified molybdenum disulfide-containing hydrotreating catalysts. This route consists of reacting the metals solutions directly with a precipitated a-alumina monohydrate (boehm- ite) hydrogel prior to extrusion. The metals-containing hydrogel is extruded directly to pellet form and subsequently dried and calcined. Catalysts formed appear to have benefits not seen with conven- tional catalysts. As an example, the metals efficiencies and utilization of these catalysts can exceed conventional catalysts by 25%. Volumetric performances of these catalysts can also be quite good. Surface areas of the new, gel-derived catalysts are significantly higher than conventional catalysts. Crush strengths of the gel catalyst pellets can show improved strength over conventionally-prepared catalysts. Possible reasons for the enhancements in properties are discussed as well as details of the experimental procedures required to prepare these catalysts.

Dry pore volume impreg- nation, however, has proven to be most successful and has led to a wide variety of commercial products. Yet, inherent in the pore volume impregnation technique are several potential limitations. For example, the total amount of metals added to the catalyst must be present and soluble in the impregnating solution, or else multiple impregnations must occur. This limitation can fix the maximum amount of metals present on the final catalyst. Another potential limitation is that the metals are deposited onto the carrier surface rather than ion:exchanged onto the surface, a procedure which can lead to losses in metals dispersion and catalyst efficiency. A potential economic liability of the conventionally-prepared catalyst system is that at least three major heating steps are involved. These include spray-drying of the original a-alumina monohydrate (boehmite) powder, often prepared from a-alu- mina trihydrate (gibbsite), extrusion and calcination of the alumina powder into a y-alumina carrier, and the final calcination after the desired metal salts are added. Since each of these three heating steps adds to the overall cost of the catalyst, any synthetic modification which eliminates one or more of them would be of economic advantage. In order to overcome these potential limitations, we now describe in this paper a new, one-step route to the oxidic forms of Ni/Mo/(P) or Co/Mo/(P) hydro- treating catalysts which eliminates two of these heating steps. This route consists of reacting the active metals solutions directly with a precipitated boehmite hydro- gel, followed by filtration and extrusion through an extruder designed to take high- water content hydrogels directly to a pellet form. The catalysts formed appear to have benefits not seen with conventionally-prepared impregnated catalysts. For example, the metals efficiencies and utilization of these catalysts can exceed cata- lysts prepared by imlSregnation. Volumetric activities of the catalysts can also meet or exceed commercial catalysts. Additionally, surface areas of the new, gel-derived catalysts are significantly higher than conventional catalysts, generally more than a factor of two. The pore size distributions of the formed catalysts can also be varied -- catalysts can be prepared which range from sharply unimodal to broadly bimodal. Lastly, possible reasons for the enhancements in properties are discussed, along with details of the experimental procedure required to prepare these catalysts. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparations In order to simulate the commercial precipitation of boehmite hydrogel from gibbsite, stock solutions of aluminum chloride or aluminum sulfate (5 wt.-% A1) and sodium aluminate (14 wt.-% A1) were used as reagents. Briefly, the acidic aluminum species and sodium aluminate were titrated in dilute aqueous solution at pH 7-8, and then the pH of the slurry was then adjusted upwards to allow crystal- R.A. Kemp, C.T. Adams/Applied Catalysis A: General 134 (1996) 299-317 301 lization to the boehmite hydrogel. This slurry was then filtered on a Buchner funnel, washed to remove the by-product salts formed and excess water removed by vac- uum, leaving a boehmite hydrogel cake with a water content of ca. 85%-90%. 85% Phosphoric acid was added to the acidic aluminum solution prior to titration if phosphated alumina hydrogels were desired. This hydrogel cake was then reacted directly with the metals-containing solutions. Depending on the exact formulation desired, these solutions contained nickel nitrate, cobalt nitrate, ammonium hepta- molybdate (AHM), and, optionally, phosphoric acid. After reaction for up to 2 h, the hydrogel was again filtered and sucked dry. This metal-containing hydrogel was then extruded using a small piston-type extruder. Initial drying of the extrudate at 120 was followed by calcination in air at 510. The detailed preparation of one example of a Ni/Mo/P/P-A1203 hydrogel catalyst is given next. 2.1.1. Preparation of D-1 740 g of NaA102 was dissolved in 1000 g of water at 60, and 544 g of A1C13.6H20 and 112 g of 85% H3PO4 were dissolved in 670 g of water and also heated to 60. The two heated solutions were placed in dropping funnels and added simultaneously into a 60 heel of 5000 g of deionized water in order to maintain a pH of 7. The titration took ca. 1370 g of the NaA102 solution and ca. 760 g of the mixed A1CI3/HaPO4 solution. After these quantities had been added the pH of the solution rose to between pH 10 and 11. The slurry was then allowed to age at 60 for one h at pH 10-11 to allow crystallization to boehmite. The slurry was filtered on a Buchner funnel, washed with approximately 50 1 of deion- ized water and the excess water was removed by vacuum. The water content of the phosphated alumina hydrogel was 85%. The following solutions were then pre- pared. 30.6 g of Ni(NO3)2.6H20 was mixed with 21.5 g of 85% H3PO4 and diluted to 500 cm3 with water. An additional solution of 45.4 g of AHM in 500 cm3 water was also prepared. The two solutions were combined slowly with stirring, and then one-third of the above hydrogel cake was added and the slurry was heated to 80 for two h at a pH of 5.0, adjusted by using a small amount of dilute HC1. At the end of two h, the slurry was filtered, washed with 2 1 of water and excess water removed by vacuum. The wet gel was then extruded using a small, piston-type extruder onto a tray. Initial drying at 120 for at least two h was followed by calcination in air at 510 for two h. 2.2. Analytical Surface areas (N2 SA) were determined by the standard BET method of nitrogen adsorption/desorption using a Micromeritics Digisorb 2500 instrument [ 2 ]. Pore size distributions were obtained by mercury intrusion using a Micromeritics Auto- pore 9210 instrument using a contact angle of 130and 0.473 N/m surface tension of mercury. Elemental compositions of Ni, Co, Mo or P were determined by neutron activation analysis or atomic absorption spectroscopy and are expressed as weight 302 R.A. Kemp, C.T. Adams/Applied Catalysis A: General 134 (1996) 299-317 percents. Compacted bulk densities (CBD) and single-pellet, flat-plate crush strength measurements on the extrudates were determined using standard proce- dures and are given in g/cm3 and lbs/pellet, respectively. 2.3. Reactor testing Catalyst samples were used to hydrotreat a catalytically-cracked heavy gas oil (CCHGO) in a trickle-flow reactor. Properties of the CCHGO are given in Table 1. Ten cm3 of the extruded catalyst were crushed and sieved to 16--45 mesh, diluted with silicon carbide and loaded into a typical trickle-flow reactor tube. The catalyst was presulfided with a 5% H2S/H2 (v/v) gas mixture at 370 for 2 h prior to testing. A CCHGO was passed over the catalyst at 343 and 57.8 bar H2 with a molar H2/oil equal to 4.0 and a LHSV of 2.0. Lined out catalyst performance data were obtained after the catalyst had been on stream for 3 days. Rate constants are reported relative to the test standard, C-324, a typical commercial Ni/Mo/P catalyst useful for general hydrotreating available from Criterion Catalyst Company, L.P., a limited partnership between Shell Oil, Royal Dutch Shell and Cytec Industries, Inc. Measured rate constants include hydrogenation (HYD), hydrodenitrification (HDN) and hydrodesulfurization (HDS). The amount of hydrogenation is meas- ured by the change in refractive index between the feed and the hydrotreated product. The changes in nitrogen and sulfur levels between feed and product are also analytically determined by chemiluminescence and X-ray fluorescence.

Absolute rate constants for each experimental catalyst are determined and then expressed as a ratio to the value determined simultaneously of the C-324 standard. This procedure allows any long-term fluctuations in the test to be negated by always referencing a standard catalyst run at the same time. Reported rate constants greater than 1.00 indicate better performance for the experimental cata- lysts. Errors in the relative rate constants are 0.03, 0.10 and 0.10, respectively, for HYD, HDN and HDS. C-324 catalyst has a compacted bulk density of 0.86 g/cm3 and a nitrogen surface area of 160 m2/g as measured by the BET method. The elemental composition of C-324 is 2.7% Ni, 13.2% Mo and 3.2% P (weight percent of the element). Two commercial Co/Mo hydrotreating catalysts, also available from Criterion Catalyst Company, L.P., were used as reference comparative cata- lysts for the Co/Mo hydrogel catalysts. C-444, a Co/Mo catalyst, has a compacted bulk density of 0.77 g/cm3 and a metals loading of 3.2% Co and 9.5% Mo. C-344, a Co/Mo/P formulation, has a compacted bulk density of 0.77 g/cm3 and a metals loading of 2.4% Co, 9.8% Mo and 2.0% P. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Preparation schemes Based on the open and patent literature, it is not unreasonable to conclude that the vast majority of commercial hydrotreating catalysts are prepared by impreg- nation of a solid catalyst support -- a process which ultimately involves several steps. While catalysts sold by individual companies obviously vary in their exact preparation scheme, a general route can be postulated which initially involves preparation of an alumina or modified-alumina powder. This powder typically is converted to an extruded catalyst support which is dried and calcined to provide well-defined physical and chemical properties. Active metals components are impregnated onto this support prior to a second calcination. Our interest in this area was to attempt to minimize the number of steps in the synthesis by reacting the active metals salts and solutions directly with the precipitated boehmite hydrogel (Fig. 1 ). A priori, it was apparent that several major technical questions were before us. Firstly, could these metals-containing solutions even be added to the delicate alumina hydrogel without complete disruption of the gel's pore structure? Secondly, is it possible to convert these metals-containing hydrogels directly into extrudates? Finally, even if these materials can be formed without major disruption of the gel structure, how will the metals utilization and catalytic performances of these hydrogel-derived catalysts compare with conventionally-prepared catalysts? It is well-understood from the literature that boehmite hydrogels can be prepared in water by the simultaneous addition of an acidic aluminum species (such as aluminum chloride or aluminum sulfate) and a basic aluminum solution (such as 304 R.A.

Conventional and hydrogel preparation routes to hydrotreating catalysts. sodium aluminate), followed by an aging period in which the gels undergo crys- tallization. Final properties of the aged hydrogels will depend upon the exact experimental conditions used. For example, the crystallinity, particle size and ele- mental composition of the gels will vary due to changes in precipitation temperature, precipitation pH, aging pH, concentrations of reagents, counterions and length of aging [ 3]. We have found that acceptable, spray-dried a-alumina monohydrate (boehmite) powders can be prepared from alumina hydrogels precipitated at pH 7-8 and 60 and aged for one h at pH 10. After aging, these boehmite gels are filtered and washed with deionized water to remove by-product sodium chloride or sodium sulfate and then dried in air on the filtration frit. The water content of the air-dried gel at this point is usually 85%-90%. It is this alumina hydrogel that we wish to directly interact with the metals solutions. 3.2. Alumina hydrogels plus acidic Ni/Mo/P solutions The initial preparations in this study involved the direct addition of an acidic solution of Ni (NO3) 2, AHM and H3PO4 to the filtered and washed alumina hydrogel precipitated at pH 7-8 and 60 and aged at pH 10. The final composition was targeted to be approximately 3.0 wt.-% Ni, 13.0 wt.-% Mo and 3.0 wt.-% P on the calcined catalyst, similar to C-324. Since it is well-known that the molybdenum species present will vary as a function of solution pH [4], we also varied the pH of the metals reslurry step from pH 5 to 10. The pH of the solution was adjusted to the desired value by adding small amounts of either HC1 or NaOH to the metals- containing hydrogel slurry. Separate experiments also examined the effect of var- R.A. Kemp, C.T.

After reaction all slurries were filtered, the wet cakes extruded through a small piston-type extruder and then dried and calcined. The resulting catalysts prepared from alumina gels and Ni/Mo/P solutions had significantly different physical properties than typical impregnated catalysts. Rep- resentative results from these catalysts are given in Table 2. When prepared at pH 8 or lower the hydrogel-derived catalysts were highly macroporous and exception- ally weak, features which led to extremely low compacted bulk densities. The compacted bulk densities of the experimental catalysts were generally less than one-third that of the commercial catalyst. Mercury porosimetry indicated that the reason for the low bulk densities and poor strength was the high fraction, between 60%-90%, of pore volume in pores greater than 1000 A in diameter. C-324, a typical commercial catalyst, has less than 2% pore volume in pores greater than 1000 A in diameter. The hydrogel catalysts prepared at pH 10 had intermediate physical properties between the macroporous catalysts prepared under acidic con- ditions and C-324. The pH 10 catalysts had single pellet crush strengths equivalent to commercial catalysts, but the bulk densities were still significantly lower. Sur- prisingly, the surface areas of hydrogel-derived catalysts were all over 400 m2/g, at least twice that of conventionally prepared catalysts, indicating that there was also a great deal of microporosity in these catalysts as well. The data in Table 2 also show the differences in chemical properties among catalysts prepared at different pH. It is obvious that the level of Mo present on the final catalyst drops dramatically upon changing the reslurry pH from 6 to 8 or higher. It is well-known that the molybdenum species in solution varies as a function of pH [4], yet all species at pH 4 or higher are all negatively-charged molybdates, or, more accurately since phosphoric acid is also present, phosphomolybdates. The alumina hydrogel, however, will change in surface charge as function of pH. The isoelectric point (IEP), or the pH value at which the surface has no net charge, of the alumina gel has been estimated to be near pH 8-9 [ 5 ]. This indicates that when the reslurry conditions are more acidic than pH 8 the surface will have a net positive 306 R.A. Kemp, C.T. Adams/Applied Catalysis A: General 134 (1996) 299-317 charge since the acidic solution will protonate the hydroxyl groups and oxide linkages present on the hydrogel. Similarly, when the pH of the metals reslurry step is greater than pH 8 the net surface charge will be negative, since these hydroxyl groups will be deprotonated by the basic solution. Since the molybdenum species in solution are all anionic over this pH range, the net effect is to have cation/anion attraction between the surface and molybdates under acidic conditions, and cation/ anion repulsions between the surface and molybdates at pH values higher than the IEP of the gel. Also indicated in Table 2 are the improvements in physical properties such as compacted bulk density and crush strength as the pH of the reslurry step is raised to 10. It may be surmised that the alumina hydrogel has a very 'delicate' structure in neutral conditions which is quite easy to disrupt by acidic protonation and cleavage of the A1-O-AI linkages present in the gel to form A1-OH groups. Incor- poration of polyanions such as phosphate and molybdate is also enhanced at lower pH, thus leading to even more disorder of the gel structure. We have seen similar behavior in alumina hydrogels precipitated from aluminum sulfate at pH 7-8 and 60 which are aged at various pH levels. Aluminas aged under basic conditions (pH 10 or higher) show only well-crystallized boehmite in the final product while aluminas aged under acidic conditions (pH 6) are essentially amorphous materials containing a large amount of occluded sulfate and little, if any, crystalline boehmite [6]. Although none of the hydrogel-derived materials contained both suitable physical and chemical properties, it was of interest to test the catalytic performance of these materials to serve as a baseline for further experiments. Shown in Table 2 are the relative rate constants for HYD, HDN and HDS results for the hydrogel catalysts related to the C-324 standard. Immediately apparent is the expected poor volumetric performances of these catalysts. Since these catalysts have such low bulk densities and, in some cases, low metals loadings, the total amount of active metal loaded into the reactor is substantially less than when using C-324. Ten cubic centimeters of C-324 contains 1.37 g of Ni + Mo; all experimental hydrogel catalysts contain 0.36 g or less of Ni + Mo. More interesting are the performances of these catalysts when examined on a metals-content basis, realizing the hydrogel catalysts contain less than one-third of the total metal in C-324. In particular, the hydrogenation and desulfurization activities of A-1 and A-2 are quite good on a metals efficiency basis and significantly exceed C-324 on that basis. Since commercial reactors are loaded .by volume and not metals loading, improvements in metals utilizations are only significant if the volumetric activities are also maintained. However, these catalytic results were indications that higher metals efficiencies may be possible using this hydrogel preparation scheme. However, the physical properties of A-1 and A-2 were unacceptable and needed to be improved. The data given in Table 2 indicate that in order to get improved physical prop- erties of the extruded alumina-derived catalyst the metals reslurry must be per- formed at high pH. However, the data also indicate that to get maximum loadings R.A. Kemp, C. T. Adams/Applied Catalysis A: General 134 (1996) 299-317 307 of molybdenum the reslurry must occur at low pH. Thus, it appears that using this particular synthetic method, alumina hydrogels will not be favored as catalyst supports for acidic Ni/Mo/P solutions. 3.3. Alumina hydrogels plus Ni/Mo (No P) solutions One possible solution to this quandary is to leave the phosphoric acid out of the metals solution entirely, forming a Ni/Mo/AI203 catalyst. However, this may be expected to adversely affect the catalyst performance, since the presence of phos- phate is known to be beneficial for performance, particularly HDN [7-9]. The physical properties of the final catalyst would be expected to be improved relative to the macroporous catalysts prepared above since the metals solution would not be as acidic as before and there would not be added phosphate to disrupt the gel structure. However, the metals reslurry must still be acidic relative to the IEP of the pure alumina hydrogel in order to get molybdate incorporation into the hydrogel. Catalysts were prepared in which solutions of Ni(NO3)2 and AHM were added to alumina hydrogels. Experiments were performed which varied the metals reslurry pH from pH 6 to 10. The lack of molybdenum incorporation seen with the Ni/Mo/ P catalysts at higher pH was also seen in these experiments. Optimal molybdenum incorporation was found by adjusting the metals reslurry step to pH 6, which allows the surface of the alumina hydrogel to be protonated and anion-attracting. Filtration, extrusion and calcination of these Ni/Mo catalysts were done as before. Physical, chemical and testing data for several typical catalysts prepared by this route are shown in Table 3. Several points can be made immediately upon examination of Table 3. Firstly, the desired effect of improving the physical properties has been met -- the Ni/Mo catalysts have single pellet crush strengths comparable to C-324 and other com- mercial catalysts. Mercury porosimetry indicates that these new catalysts are all unimodal materials with at least 70% of the pore volume in pores loess than 70 ,~ in diameter and no pore volume located in pores greater than 1000 A in diameter.

Mercury porosimetry data for typical Ni/Mo/(no P)/AI203 hydrogel catalyst. typical mercury porosimetry PSD is shown in Fig. 2, which shows clearly the narrow pore size distributions exhibited by these materials. Secondly, it is very easy to prepare catalysts which exceed the total metal loadings present on impreg- nated catalysts. The higher metal loadings coupled with the small pores and the narrow pore size distribution give these catalysts high compacted bulk densities. In fact, these bulk densities now exceed that of the commercial catalyst. The micro- pores present in the final catalyst again lead to high surface areas, similarly to the Ni/Mo/P hydrogel catalysts. Most interesting are the actual catalytic performances of these materials shown in Table 3. The hydrogenation ability of these Ni/Mo catalysts now meets or exceeds C-324 and the desulfurization ability of these catalysts surpasses C-324 by up to 30%. As feared, however, the volumetric HDN performances, while improved over the low-density Ni/Mo/P hydrogel catalysts, were still clearly lower than C- 324. Interestingly, the HDN performance of a C-324 type catalyst prepared without phosphorus drops to ca. 0.80 and is similar to these Ni/Mo hydrogel catalysts. While it was encouraging to note the improvement in absolute performance of these Ni/Mo catalysts over their P-containing counterparts, it was disappointing to note that the gains in performance were strictly a function of increased total metals loaded into the reactor and not due to an improvement in metals utilization. In fact, these catalysts are now substantially less efficient than the C-324 standard, using 60%-90% more metal in the reactor to achieve a 30% maximum gain in HDS and a 20% loss in HDN. It was also apparent that added phosphorus would likely be necessary in order to prepare highly active HDN catalysts. 3.4. Phosphated alumina hydrogels plus Ni/Mo/P solutions The above experiments showed that the use of alumina hydrogels as reagents was not going to provide catalysts with commercial level volumetric activities in R.A. Kemp, C.T. Adams/Applied Catalysis A: General 134 (1996) 299-317 309 conjunction with an improvement in metals efficiency. Before abandoning this approach we were interested in preparing modified alumina hydrogels with altered properties in hopes of combining good performance with increased efficiency. It was hypothesized above that at least part of the reason for the macroporosity in the Ni/Mo/P catalysts was due to the protonation and destruction of the alumina gel structure under acidic conditions, since the IEP of the gel was estimated to be near pH 8 [ 8]. If a modified alumina hydrogel could be prepared which had a lower IEP than pure alumina, it may be possible that the acidic Ni/Mo/P solution would not affect it as dramatically as the alumina hydrogel, yet the modified gel would still be protonated enough on the surface to attract the desired molybdates. Pure aluminum phosphate has an IEP of 3.2 and so the initial target was to prepare a mixed alumina/aluminum phosphate hydrogel in hopes of lowering the IEP of the hydrogel to a value intermediate between pure alumina and pure aluminum phos- phate. In order to have minimal effect on the overall pore structure we targeted for a net 10%-15% incorporation of A1PO4 into the alumina gel. Phosphoric acid was generally dissolved into the aluminum chloride or aluminum sulfate solution to provide a source of phosphate, although identical results were also obtained when sodium phosphate was added to the sodium aluminate solution. The catalyst syn- thesis after the precipitation step was identical to that using the alumina hydrogel. The properties of several catalysts prepared using phosphated aluminas as supports are shown in Table 4, along with a alumina-derived catalyst (A-I, discussed above) and C-324 to serve as references. The Ni/Mo/P catalysts prepared using phosphated aluminas have considerably different properties from alumina hydrogel catalysts. Rather than the macroporous and weak extrudates seen previously, the catalysts prepared using phosphated aluminas are extremely strong and contain essentially no macropores. In that regard, the new catalysts resemble very closely the pore structures of the Ni/Mo (no P) catalysts discussed earlier. However, the bulk densities of the phosphated alumina catalysts are not as high as the Ni/Mo (no P) catalysts, but are still substantially higher than the 0.25 g/cm3 values seen with the macroporous catalysts.

Kemp, C.T. Adams/Applied Catalysis A: General 134 (1996) 299-317 with other hydrogel catalysts, these materials all have surface areas more than twice that of impregnated catalysts. Mercury porosimetry confirms the unimodal nature of the catalyst pore size distributions, showing greater than 80% of the pore volume residing in pores less than 70 ,~ in diameter. However, there is now one important difference between phosphated alumina catalysts and the alumina-derived catalysts discussed earlier. These catalysts now have two of the characteristics which are believed necessary for achieving our targets. The first feature is that the pore structure present in the phosphated alumina catalysts is such that strong, unimodal, mesoporous catalysts with compacted bulk densities 10%-25% lower than conven- tional catalysts can be prepared. The second feature is that added phosphate, believed important to maximize HDN performance, is present in these catalysts. In fact, there is a higher amount of phosphate present on these catalysts than in C-324 since phosphate is added both during the precipitation (ca. 3%) as well as in the metals solution (ca. 3%) and this is confirmed by the elemental analyses. The catalyst performance testing results are particularly noteworthy when com- pared to either the alumina hydrogel catalyst or C-324. All three of the phosphated alumina hydrogel catalysts have equivalent hydrogenation and denitrification activ- ities as C-324. In addition, all three catalysts show improvements in desulfurization performances as well. Thus, the volumetric activities of these phosphated alumina catalysts meet or exceed the commercial performance of C-324. Most importantly, all three phosphated alumina hydrogel catalysts have met the C-324 performance level while using 5%-25% less total metal in the reactor. These catalysts indicate that it is possible to prepare hydrogel Ni/Mo/P catalysts which have equivalent volumetric activities and improved metals utilizations versus C-324 catalyst, which was a major goal of this research project. The role of reslurry pH has been mentioned throughout as an important experi- mental variable. Another important synthesis variable is the reslurry temperature. We have examined the effects of varying the reslurry temperature from 25 to 80 with the results shown in Table 5. In this experiment a large batch of phosphated alumina hydrogel was divided into three portions and reslurried with identical Ni/ Mo/P solutions at different temperatures. The temperature effect is dramatic upon the final density of the catalyst. As the temperature is raised the density of the catalyst smoothly decreases from 0.90 to 0.68 g/cm3. The pore size distributions, however, are almost identical for all three catalysts. The change in density can be attributed to the slurry being more colloidal at lower temperatures and, thus, giving a more dense product. 3.5. Phosphated alumina hydrogels plus Ni/Mo (No P) solutions Although it has just been shown that is possible to prepare strong, mesoporous highly-efficient Ni/Mo/P catalysts using phosphated alumina hydrogels, it was also of interest to determine whether the phosphate present during the hydrogel precipitation step was sufficient to aid in the HDN activity, or whether the phosphate R.A.

In order to study this, we prepared Ni/Mo (no P) catalysts upon phosphated alumina hydrogels, which utilizes phos- phorus only in the support. Catalyst properties for three typical catalysts are shown in Table 6. The physical and chemical properties of these catalysts are very similar to those Ni/Mo (no P) catalysts prepared on alumina gels. Once again, the metals loadings are higher than what can be achieved using single impregnations. Also, the catalysts have similar pore structures to the alumina-derived catalysts, with the vast majority of pore volume being located in pores less than 50 A in diameter. The catalyst testing results are also quite similar to the alumina catalysts. As before, hydrogenation activities are equal to C-324, the HDS activities are slightly improved, but the HDN activities are roughly 20% lower than C-324, the same as the phosphorus-free version of C-324. This implies that it does matter how the phosphorus is added to the hydrogel catalyst. The mere presence of phosphorus itself is not enough to effect the HDN reaction; most likely, for optimal HDN performance the phosphorus should be added in the metals solution.

Alumina hydrogels plus Co/Mo/P or Co/Mo (No P) solutions Above we saw that with Ni/Mo/P additions to alumina hydrogels only weak, macroporous catalysts were formed when these acidic metals solutions were inter- acted with alumina gels aged at pH 10. As expected, simple substitution of Co for Ni gave identical results after extrusion and calcining -- highly macroporous catalysts with essentially no structural integrity. We then reasoned that if the pro- tonation by the acidic solution was causing the changes to the pore structure we might be able to partially neutralize the solution in situ during the course of the reaction. One way of doing this was to age the alumina gel not at pH 10, but rather at pH 11-12 in order to build up an excess of basic 'Na20' on the alumina. This can be done by adjusting the pH upwards to the desired level with excess NaAIO2 at the conclusion of the precipitation step and maintaining the high pH during the aging step. Thus, the only difference in the routes between these preparations and the previous work is the aging pH of the alumina gel prior to interaction with the metals. Typical physical properties of catalysts prepared by the higher pH aging route are shown in Table 7. Series G catalysts had a higher level of P than series F catalysts. Pore volume measurements are obtained by mercury porosimetry and show the fraction of volume in pores less than 150 .~ in diameter. Clearly, data shown in Table 7 indicate that the porosities of the Co/Mo/P catalysts prepared using alumina hydrogels aged at pH 11-12 are significantly different from the corresponding comparison catalyst made using pH 10-aged alumina hydrogels. The macroporosity in the comparison catalyst as measured by o the percent pore volume located in pores greater than 350 A is especially noteworthy to distinguish it from the F series or G series catalysts. It is also apparent that the R.A. Kemp, C.T.

Compacted bulk densities of Co/Mo/P catalysts on A1203 or P-AI203 supports as a function of reslurry temperature. pore structures of the pH 11-12 aged materials resemble impregnated catalysts in that the vast majority of the pore volume is located in mesopores less than 150 ,~, in diameter. Interestingly, the effect of P level on compacted bulk density as a function of reslurry temperature can also be seen in Table 7 and more directly in Fig. 3. As the temperature of the metals reslurry with the alumina hydrogel is increased from 25 to 80 the compacted bulk densities of the resulting catalysts smoothly decrease. This can be attributed to the hydrogel slurry being more col- loidal at lower temperatures. As the amount of phosphorus increases in the final catalyst composition from series F to G, the effect of temperature on density also appears to be increased. One limiting case of this situation is when no P is present in the metals reslurry solution. We have seen in the above results with Ni/Mo catalysts as well as this work (vida infra) that there is no effect on catalyst com- pacted bulk density as a function of reslurry temperature when P is absent from the metals solution. One advantage of this effect is that catalyst bulk densities can be 'dialed in' in a systematic manner by merely changing P levels and reslurry tem- peratures, rather than the traditional method of adjusting metals loadings in impreg- nated catalysts. As mentioned above, phosphoric acid can be left out of the metals solutions entirely. If so, high density catalysts can be prepared which contain only Co/Mo on A1203. Since the acidic component is absent it would be expected that the pore structure of the resulting hydrogel catalysts would not be dramatically different than conventional catalysts and examination of Table 8 shows that to be the case. These new catalysts, series H, are strong, mesoporous materials with the very high surface areas seen on all hydrogel catalysts. Interesting is the fact that the compacted bulk densities of these Co/Mo/A1203 catalysts do not change as a function of 314 R.A. Kemp, C.T.

This is consistent with the Ni/Mo results seen previously -- phosphorus added with the metals is the cause of the density variations at different reslurry temperatures and this lack of variation is also compatible with the discus- sion concerning Co/Mo/P catalysts. Catalyst testing results show these Co/Mo catalysts as expected have high HDS activities relative to C-324, a Ni/Mo/P catalyst and have similar volumetric activities to commercial impregnated Co/Mo catalysts such as C-344 and C-444. However, on a metals utilization basis the hydrogel catalysts are worse than C-444, since the metals loadings of all catalysts are very similar but the bulk densities of the gel catalysts are 15% higher than C- 444. Thus, at this point, Co-Mo hydrogel catalysts prepared on aluminas do not show any performance advantages over conventionally-prepared catalysts, either on a volumetric basis or on a metals efficiency basis. 3. 7. Phosphated alumina hydrogels plus Co/Mo (no P) or Co/Mo/P solutions Work above showed that it is possible to use phosphated alumina hydrogels as starting materials for these syntheses. Use of these phosphated alumina hydrogels as the starting reagents allows mesoporous catalysts to be formed, even if the metals solutions contain phosphoric acid. Shown in Table 9 are examples of catalysts utilizing Co/Mo and Co/Mo/P solutions added to phosphated alumina hydrogels. As with the nickel catalysts very strong, mesoporous catalysts are formed when phosphated aluminas are used as catalyst supports. The I series of catalysts (Co/ Mo/P-A1203) in Table 9 shows similar CCHGO testing results to the Co/Mo/ A1203 catalysts seen in Table 8. Catalysts which are very active for HDS can be prepared which have comparable volumetric performances as commercial C-344 and C-444. However, the excellent volumetric performances of series I can be ascribed to the higher metals loadings and higher bulk densities of the catalysts R.A. Kemp, C. T.

Reslurry pH 5.5. a C-324 is a Ni/Mo/P/A1203 catalyst. relative to the commercial catalysts and not to any improvement in metals efficiency. As above, the metals utilizations of these hydrogel catalysts are actually poorer than impregnated catalysts. This is not the case with the Co/Mo/P/P-AI203 catalysts (series J). Again, all of these catalysts show equivalent or superior HDS performances on a volumetric basis, but J-4 and J-5, the lower density catalysts, also show increased metals utilizations. For example, the total amount of metal loaded into the CCHGO reactor for J-4 is 0.92 g and for J-5 is 0.82 g, while the total metal loaded for C-344 is 0.94 g and for C-444 is 0.98 g. Therefore, these catalysts meet our initial targets of providing catalysts which are equivalent to commercial HDS catalysts on a reactor volume basis as well as providing a more efficient use of the total metal present. The phosphorus impact on density as a function of reslurry temperature with P- A1203 catalysts can also be seen in Table 9 and Fig. 3. For the I series -- consisting of catalysts where there is no phosphorus added to the metals solutions-- essentially no impact on compacted bulk density is seen as the reslurry temperature is raised from 25 to 80. All phosphorus present in the final catalyst comes from the phosphated alumina support. However, in the J series, where 1%-2% additional phosphorus is added to the metals solutions (in addition to the 2%-3% phosphorus present in the support), a strong influence of reslurry temperature on catalyst bulk density can be seen, a trend consistent with the results seen above using aluminas and Co/Mo and Co/Mo/P solutions. As previously mentioned, this feature allows 316 R.A. Kemp, C.T. Adams/Applied Catalysis A: General 134 (1996) 299-317 the flexibility of systematically changing catalyst densities by merely changing metals reslurry temperatures. 4. Conclusions We have shown that highly efficient Ni/Mo and Co/Mo hydrotreating catalysts can be prepared in a simple synthesis which uses alumina or phosphated alumina hydrogels as a synthetic reagent. This new route requires only one heating step, that to dry and calcine the final catalyst, rather than the three heating steps needed for preparing catalysts by impregnation. The final catalysts formed have extremely high surface areas and the pore structures of these materials can be varied, although optimal catalysts have most of their pore volume located in pores less than 100 A in diameter. While the use of alumina hydrogels gives mainly macroporous cata- lysts, these catalysts were valuable in that they demonstrated that increased metals efficiencies were possible using this hydrogel route. A key step involved the co- precipitating of phosphate with the alumina gel to allow formation of a mixed alumina/aluminum phosphate gel. This mixed gel could be reacted with acidic Ni/ Mo/P solutions to provide catalysts which met or exceeded volumetric HDN and HDS performances of C-324 catalyst with lower loadings of metals in the reactor. We have also shown that the manner in which the phosphorus is incorporated into the hydrogel catalyst can affect the amount of HDN benefit seen. For Co/Mo catalysts, phosphorus added during the metals reslurry can affect the catalyst bulk densities as a function of the reslurry temperature and as such can be used to 'dial in' a desired catalyst density. Co/Mo/Alz03 catalysts can be prepared which meet the commercial volumetric hydrodesulfurization performances of commercial HDS catalysts. Co/Mo/P/P-A1203 catalysts also show equivalent volumetric HDS activities as the commercial catalysts, but also can demonstrate a more efficient use of the metals on the catalyst. The simplification of the synthetic scheme and improvement in metals utilizations make these catalysts very attractive from an economic sense. Extensions of the hydrogel route to prepare catalysts useful for chemical syntheses are subjects of ongoing studies [ 10]. Acknowledgements The authors wish to thank Ms. Ramona J. Rhines, Ms. Lori L.

While this route has proven to be quite successful and has led to a variety of commercial products, inherent in the pore volume impregnation technique are several potential limitations. These limitations may be chemical or economic in nature. In order to overcome these potential limitations, we have developed a new, one-step route to the oxidic form of these nickel or cobalt modified molybdenum disulfide-containing hydrotreating catalysts. This route consists of reacting the metals solutions directly with a precipitated α-alumina monohydrate (boehmite) hydrogel prior to extrusion. The metals-containing hydrogel is extruded directly to pellet form and subsequently dried and calcined. Catalysts formed appear to have benefits not seen with conventional catalysts. As an example, the metals efficiencies and utilization of these catalysts can exceed conventional catalysts by 25%. Volumetric performances of these catalysts can also be quite good. Surface areas of the new, gel-derived catalysts are significantly higher than conventional catalysts. Crush strengths of the gel catalyst pellets can show improved strength over conventionally-prepared catalysts. Possible reasons for the enhancements in properties are discussed as well as details of the experimental procedures required to prepare these catalysts.
