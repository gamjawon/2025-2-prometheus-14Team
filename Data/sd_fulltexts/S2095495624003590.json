Graphical abstract The synergistic effect of pre-intercalated Mn2+ and H2O enlarge the interlayer spacing and improve the stability of MVOH for aqueous zinc-ion batteries. Zn2+/H+ co–(de)intercalation mechanism is also validated through in-situ and ex-situ characterizations. Aqueous Zn-ion batteries (AZIBs) are recognized as a promising energy storage system with intrinsic safety and low cost, but its applications still rely on the design of high-capacity and stable-cycling cathode materials. In this work, we present an intercalation mechanism-based cathode materials for AZIB, i.e. the vanadium oxide with pre-intercalated manganese ions and lattice water (noted as MVOH). The synergistic effect between Mn2+ and lattice H2O not only expands the interlayer spacing, but also significantly enhances the structural stability. Systematic in-situ and ex-situ characterizations clarify the Zn2+/H+ co–(de)intercalation mechanism of MVOH in aqueous electrolyte. The demonstrated remarkable structure stability, excellent kinetic behaviors and ion-storage mechanism together enable the MVOH to demonstrate satisfactory specific capacity of 450 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1, excellent rate performance of 288.8 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1 and long cycle life over 20,000 cycles at 5 A g−1. This work provides a practical cathode material, and contributes to the understanding of the ion-intercalation mechanism and structural evolution of the vanadium-based cathode for AZIBs. Keywords Zn-ion batteries Vanadium oxide Pre-intercalation Lattice water Manganese ion 1 Introduction Aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) have emerged as a highly promising energy storage system due to their relatively high energy density, abundant natural reserves, low cost, and intrinsic safety [1–6]. The exploration of cathode materials, which could coordinate the (de)intercalation of large amount of Zn ions at high redox potential, is essential for improving the energy density and stability of ZIBs [7,8]. In recent years, a variety of Zn2+-intercalation materials have been demonstrated as cathode materials, such as manganese-based oxides [9,10], vanadium-based oxides [11–14], Prussian blue analogs [15,16], organic compounds [17,18], and layered sulfide compounds [19,20]. Among them, vanadium-based cathodes stand out for the high theoretical capacities, for instance, the theoretical capacity is 589 mA h g−1 for V2O5, 645.8 mA h g−1 for VO2 and 715 mA h g−1 for V2O3. The characteristic multiple valence states of vanadium (from V2+ to V5+) allow the multi-electron transfer of vanadium-based cathodes, accounting for the high theoretical capacity and the resulting high energy density. Furthermore, the rapid charge diffusion rate could be promoted by the open framework structure of V-based cathodes. Therefore, significant attention has been paid to vanadium-based cathodes for aqueous ZIBs. However, some challenges are still restricting the development and application of vanadium-based cathode materials. The low electronic conductivity of vanadium-based materials is closely associated with their intrinsic electronic structure. The composite of vanadium-based and carbon-based materials has been reported to be an effective approach for enhancing electronic conductivity [21–23]. Moreover, strong electrostatic interactions of the large-sized Zn ions with the host vanadium materials could result in the sluggish diffusion kinetics for (de)intercalation of Zn ions [24]. Defect engineering is considered as a viable strategy, capable of weakening electrostatic interactions to promote rapid Zn ion migration [25,26]. Furthermore, the poor cyclic stability is a significant challenge for vanadium-based materials, since the (de)intercalation of large Zn ions could also make the cathode prone to structural collapse due to the strong electrostatic interaction and repeated lattice “breath”. In recent years, pre-intercalated metal ions, organic groups, or water molecules have been shown to be advantageous in addressing these issues [27–29]. It is reported that the pre-intercalated species could expand the interlayer spacing, tune the electronic structure, facilitate the rapid transfer of Zn ions and therefore improve the electrochemical performances [30–33]. However, the precise roles of pre-intercalated metal ions and lattice water molecules within the interlayers remain unclear, and their synergistic cooperation effects have been overlooked. Herein, a straightforward one-step hydrothermal method has been employed to synthesize hydrated vanadium oxides with pre-intercalated manganese ions (MVOH). By comparing layered vanadium oxides with and without pre-embedded Mn2+, it is found that Mn2+ ions effectively improved the structural stability of MVOH, and the lattice water contributed to the enlarged interlayer spacing. The synergistic effects between the Mn2+ and lattice water are essential to achieve the stability and reversibility of lattice structure. The systematic ex-situ and in-situ characterizations revealed the high reversible structure evolution of the V-O skeleton and the mechanism of Zn2+/H+ co–(de)intercalation during the electrochemical cycles in aqueous electrolytes. Benefiting from the promoted ion-storage mechanisms by the pre-intercalated Mn2+ and lattice water, the MVOH cathode achieved high reversible specific capacity of 450 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1, rate capability of 175.1 mA h g−1 at 30 A g−1, and remarkable cycle life of 20,000 cycles at 5 A g−1. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials Vanadium pentoxide (V2O5, 99.5%) was purchased from Shanghai Energy Chemical Co., Ltd. Zinc trifluoromethanesulfonate (Zn(OTF)2, 98%) and Manganese sulfate monohydrate (MnSO4·2H2O, 99%) were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. Oxalic acid dihydrate (C2H2O4·2H2O, 98%) was purchased from Beijing innochem Science and Technology Ltd. Acetonitrile was purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. 2.2 Synthesis of MVOH and VOH The MVOH was prepared by using a hydrothermal method. Initially, 2 mmol of V2O5, and 2 mmol of MnSO4·H2O were dissolved in 70 mL of deionized (DI) water with 2 mmol of H2C2O4·2H2O and stirred vigorously for 0.5 h under ambient conditions. Subsequently, the resulting yellow solution was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 200 °C for 6 h. After cooling to room temperature, the obtained precipitate was washed with deionized water and alcohol several times. Finally, the synthesized products were dried at 70 °C in air for 12 h. VOH was prepared by using the same proportions and methods without adding MnSO4·H2O. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Characterizations of MVOH and the synergism of Mn2+ and lattice water Fig. 1 (a) illustrates the synthesis procedure of the Mn2+ and lattice water cointercalated vanadium oxides (MVOH) through an one-step hydrothermal method. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the precursor vanadium penoxide (V2O5) and the product (MVOH) are shown in Fig. S2, and the corresponding crystal structure diagram is described in Fig. 1(a). Fig. 1(b) depicts the phase purity and crystallinity of MVOH, analyzed through Rietveld refinement XRD data with convergence factors R p = 6.75% and R wp = 6.02%. Based on the space group C2/m, the lattice constants of the monoclinic MVOH are calculated as follows: a = 19.94 Å, b = 3.49 Å, c = 13.34 Å, and α = 90°, β = 127°, γ = 90°. The lattice spacing of the (001) lattice plane, calculated from the Bragg equation, is determined to be 10.27 Å. In Fig. S1, the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves of MVOH, Mn-free hydrated vanadium oxide (VOH), and precursor V2O5 were obtained under an argon atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 from 5 to 800 °C. MVOH and VOH exhibited noticeable weight losses, while V2O5 showed no variation. The weight loss of MVOH and VOH in the range of 5–100 °C is attributed to the evaporation of physically adsorbed water, whereas the weight loss beyond 100 °C is ascribed to the loss of lattice water. Inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) was employed for the quantitative analysis of Mn, V, and O in MVOH, and the results are summarized in Table S1. According to the TGA and ICP-OES results, the molecular formula of the as-synthesized material is determined to be Mn0.1VO2.4·0.3H2O (MVOH). The morphology characteristics of MVOH, VOH and V2O5 were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. S3). The MVOH reveals a nanorod morphology (Fig. S3a), which mitigates material aggregation, resulting in a high specific surface area of 22.8 m2 g−1 (Fig. S6). VOH exhibits identical nanorod morphology, and V2O5 displays the large nanosheet morphology (Fig. S3b and c). As shown in Fig. 1(c), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy image of MVOH reveals the lattice distance of 10.02 Å, consistent with the (001) peak of XRD in Fig. 1(b), highlighting a large interlayer spacing which could provide an open and stable pathway for rapid ion transport. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, Fig. 1d) confirm that Mn2+ is successfully introduced into vanadium oxides, and the homogeneous distribution of Mn, V, and O elements in MVOH. The HRTEM image of VOH (Fig. S3b) demonstrates a large interlayer spacing of 11.51 Å, corresponding to the (001) peak in XRD (Fig. S2), indicating the expansion effect of lattice water on interlayer distance. Conversely, TEM (Fig. S3c) and XRD data of V2O5 suggest its non-layered orthorhombic structure. Fig. S4 presents the live profile of the IFFT analysis of HRTEM. Additionally, the EDS images of VOH and V2O5 are shown in Fig. S5(a and b). The XPS of MVOH were further analyzed in Fig. S7. The fitted XPS spectrum of Mn 2p (Fig. 1e) exhibits two dominant peaks at 641.88 and 653.48 eV, corresponding to Mn 2p 1/2 and Mn 2p 3/2, respectively. The satellite peak at 646.48 eV confirms the divalent nature of Mn ions [34,35]. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (Fig. S8) reveals peaks at 540.0 and 999.1 cm−1, assigned to the out-of-plane VOV vibration [36] and bending vibration of VO bonds [37], respectively. The absorption peak at 767.6 cm−1 is attributed to the stretching vibration of V–O–V bonds [38]. Furthermore, absorption peaks at 1627.8 and 3427.3 cm−1 arise from OH vibrations, consistent with the presence of lattice water [36,39]. Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 1f) was employed to analyze the MnO bonds of MVOH, and peak fitting of the Raman spectra in the range of 600–800 cm−1 was conducted based on the Lorentzian function. In MVOH, the weak peak at 655 cm−1 is attributed to the vibration of the Mn-O bonds, which are absent in VOH [34]. Moreover, XRD results of MVOH powder (Fig. 1g) and VOH powder (Fig. 1h) under different treatment methods were conducted to investigate the role of interlayer Mn2+ and lattice H2O. These two samples were dried at 320 °C in an argon atmosphere to remove the lattice water, and then soaked in DI water to recover the lattice water molecules again. Fig. 1(g and h) illustrate the XRD results of (1) the pristine, (2) 320 °C argon-dried, (3) recovered MVOH and VOH, respectively. As for MVOH, the diffraction peaks at high 2θ values of pristine and dried samples exhibit good correspondence, but the (001) peak shifts to a higher 2θ angle (from 8.4° to 10.1°), indicating the reduced interlayer spacing. We speculate that the Mn2+ and a small amount of water molecules are left as interlayer pillars to maintain the lattice structure, even though the volatilization of lattice water at high temperatures reduces the lattice interlayer spacing. Interestingly, after soaking in DI water, the crystal lattice structure can be fully recovered (XRD patterns are fully consistent with the pristine MVOH), suggesting the re-intercalation of water molecules between interlayers of MVOH after soaking in DI water. As for the VOH without pre-intercalated Mn2+, the pristine interlayer spacing (2θ = 7.2°) is larger than that of MVOH (2θ = 8.4°). This indicates that lattice water plays a major role in enlarging the interlayer spacing; while the slightly smaller interlayer spacing of MVOH than VOH is probably due to the strong electrostatic effect of divalent metal ions (Mn2+) with the vanadium-based host. However, in sharp contrast to MVOH, the 320 °C-dried VOH sample shows no obvious (001) XRD peak and the crystal structure can not be recovered after soaking in DI water (Fig. 1h), suggesting that the water molecules cannot be re-intercalated into the distorted crystal. Therefore, it can be concluded that the synergistic cooperation effects between manganese ions and lattice water not only enlarge the interlayer spacing of layered vanadium oxide but also enhance the stability of the structure. 3.2 The kinetic behaviors of MVOH To evaluate the electrochemical kinetic behavior of MVOH cathode materials, cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests in CR-2032 coin-type cells were conducted within the voltage range of 0.2–1.6 V and at scan rates of 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0 mV s−1. The CV curves (Fig. 2 a) reveal three pairs of redox peaks situated at 0.68/0.62 V, 1.03/0.96 V, and 1.37/1.34 V, respectively, indicating the multi-step redox reactions. Importantly, the MVOH exhibits three pairs of redox peaks under varied scan rates, demonstrating consistent electrochemical behavior. The relationship between peak currents (i) and scan rates (ν) is expressed by the formula [40,41]. (1) i = a · v b The b-value represents the charge-storage mechanism of materials, with 0.5 indicating a diffusion-controlled process and 1 representing surface capacitive behavior. The b value is quantified by the slope of the logi/logν of the redox peaks (Fig. 2b). For MVOH, the fitted b values of peaks 1–6 are 0.87, 0.93, 0.85, 0.93, 0.98 and, 1.12, respectively, suggesting that the charge storage process in the electrode is controlled by ion diffusion and pseudocapacitance, and the pseudocapacitance behavior is dominant. Moreover, the proportions of different types of capacity can be divided into two processes: pseudocapacitive process (k 1 ν) and diffusion-controlled process (k 2 ν 1/2), as expressed in the formula. (2) i = k 1 v + k 2 v 1 / 2 where k 1 and k 2 are adjustable parameters, ν and i represent scan rate and current, respectively. With an increase in scan rate from 0.1 to 1.0 mV s−1, the pseudocapacitve contribution rises from 76% to 91% (Fig. 2c). Fig. 2(d) illustrates that the pseudocapacitve contribution accounts for 91% of the total capacity at 1.0 mV s−1. To gain deeper insights into the solid-state ion diffusion kinetics within MVOH, VOH, and V2O5, we employed the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT), as detailed in the experimental section. Fig. S9 illustrates a typical GITT step during discharge process. As depicted in Fig. 2(e), the ionic diffusion coefficient (D) of MVOH is calculated to be 10−10–10−9 cm2 s−1, showing the fast Zn2+ diffusion kinetics in MVOH. As shown in Fig. S10, VOH exhibits a faster ion diffusion coefficient (10−10–10−9) compared to MVOH, attributed to its larger interlayer spacing, providing a more open pathway for ion transport. While the ionic diffusion coefficient of the non-layered V2O5 shows 10−11. Therefore, the increased interlayer spacing resulting from the pre-insertion of Mn2+ and lattice water is beneficial for the rapid kinetics of MVOH. Self-discharge behavior was examined to measure the stability of the MVOH (Fig. 2f). The voltage retention rate stands at 82% after charging to 1.6 V at 1 A g−1 and resting for 48 h. The Coulombic efficiency (the ratio of the discharge capacity after relaxation to charge capacity before relaxation) reaches 93.5%, confirming the excellent stability of MVOH. 3.3 The electrochemical performances of MVOH in aqueous Zn battery The CV curves (Fig. 3 a) for the first four cycles of MVOH were acquired by using the three-electrode system at a scan rate of 0.3 mV s−1. The repeatability of redox peaks indicate the high reversibility. The smaller areas of the first CV test are due to the activation process of MVOH, and the same phenomenon is characterized by galvanostatic charge–discharge tests (GCD) (Fig. 3b) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (Fig. 3c). In Fig. 3b, the discharge capacity increases from 340 mA h g−1 at the 1st cycle to 450 mA h g−1 at subsequent cycles, aligning well with the activation process. Moreover, the voltage plateau of charge–discharge curve corresponds well with the redox peaks of CV profiles. The rate performance and long-term cycle performance of MVOH, VOH, and V2O5 in aqueous Zn-ion batteries were then systematically evaluated by using 3 M Zn(OTF)2 aqueous electrolyte (Fig. 3d–f, Fig. S11). MVOH cathode delivers specific capacities of 435, 391, 288, 222, and 175.1 mA h g−1 at 1, 5, 10, 20, and 30 A g−1 (Fig. 3d and e). Especially, the discharge capacity retains 440 mA h g−1 when the current density returns to 1 A g−1, attesting to the superior stability and rate performance of MVOH. The good overlap of the corresponding voltage-capacity curves (Fig. 3e) indicates that the electrochemical mechanism of MVOH is consistent at different current densities. Benefitting from these superior electrochemical properties, Zn||MVOH batteries demonstrate long-life cycling performance. The MVOH exhibits a discharge capacity of 415 mA h g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1 with a capacity retention of 75.3% after 4000 cycles (Fig. 3f). As a contrast, VOH demonstrates similar rate capability to MVOH but exhibits inferior cycling life. The precursor V2O5 shows poor performance in both rate capability and cycling stability. Despite pre-inserted Mn2+ sacrifice some interlayer spacing, an extended cycling life is achieved. This highlights the synergistic interaction between manganese ions and lattice water, endowing MVOH with excellent cycling stability and satisfactory capacity. Further investigation into the charge–discharge behavior and structural characteristics of MVOH is conducted to verify its cycling stability. As shown in Fig. S12, the charge–discharge curves of MVOH remain consistent at the 500th, 1000th, 2000th, 3000th, and 4000th cycles, validating the long-term cycling stability of MVOH. XRD spectra were conducted on MVOH electrodes after long cycles in Fig. S13. The characteristic peaks after 1st, 300th, and 650th cycles were found to be essentially identical to those of the pristine MVOH powder, thereby confirming the structural stability of the MVOH. Additionally, MVOH exhibits a high capacity of 383.4 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1 (Fig. 2h), remarkable cycle life of 20,000 cycles, and a capacity retention rate as high as 83.5% at the 10,000th cycle compared to the highest capacity after activation. The Ragone plot (Fig. 2g) demonstrates that the MVOH delivers higher energy densities across a broad range of power densities compared to many reported vanadium-based materials [42–47]. Detailed data for the reported work is listed in the Table S3. 3.4 The Zn2+/H+ co-intercalation mechanism of MVOH in aqueous electrolyte To elucidate the structural evolution and mechanism of MVOH during electrochemical storage processes, an array of in-situ and ex-situ characterizations were conducted. In Fig. 4 (a), the XPS date of V 2p is deconvolved into fitted peaks of V5+ (517.38 and 525 eV) and V4+ (515.98 and 523.5 eV) in pristine MVOH. During discharging to 0.2 V, the V4+ feature increases and V3+ appears, indicating the reduction of V5+ and V4+ species with the insertion of carrier ions (Zn2+/H+). When charging to 1.6 V, the valence state of V returns to initial state, affirming the highly reversible process of MVOH. The XPS of Zn 2p (Fig. S14a) was conducted to confirm the de-intercalation of Zn2+ in MVOH. In pristine MVOH, no signal of Zn element was observed. In the fully discharged state, XPS peaks at 1022 and 1045 eV correspond to the intercalated Zn2+, while peaks at 1021 and 1044 eV represent physically adsorbed Zn2+ from the electrolyte. While in the fully charged state, only physically adsorbed Zn2+ are observed, corroborating the reversible insertion/de-insertion mechanism of Zn2+. TEM-EDS images (Fig. 4c) display the uniform distribution of Mn2+ at fully discharged (above) and fully charged (below), confirming the stability of Mn2+ as interlayer pillars in MVOH. The XPS of O 1s (Fig. S14b) is deconvolved into three fitted peaks of 529.9 eV (VOV) [28], 531.7 eV (VOH) [48], and 532.5 eV (physically adsorbed water) [49]. The VOH peak is obviously enhanced at fully discharged state and weakened at fully charged state, indicating that H+ participates in reversible cycles [50–52]. Compared with the pristine MVOH, the peaks during cycles exhibit an obvious blue shift, which is due to the interaction changes of VO bond with the insertion and de-insertion of Zn2+/H+ ions. Ex-situ Raman spectroscopy provides additional insights into the structural evolution of MVOH during electrochemical process. For pristine MVOH, the strongest peak at 141 cm−1 is attributed to the skeleton bending vibration of VOV [53]. The peaks at 282 and 993 cm−1 originate from the bending and stretching vibrations of V5+=O [53,54], while the peak at 406 cm−1 is due to the bending vibrations of bridging OVO [55]. The band at 690 cm−1 is assigned to the doubly coordinated oxygen stretching mode (V2-O, connect two VO x of shared angles) [56,57]. In fully discharged state, the VOV bond at 141 cm−1 significantly weakens, reflecting the strong interaction of VO bond in a-b plane with the insertion of Zn2+/H+ ions [58]. The VO bond (terminal O) at 282 cm−1 red-shifts to 257 cm−1, showing the expansion along the c-direction. The red shift of OVO bond at 406 cm−1 demonstrates the expansion along the b-direction. In summary, the red shift of VO bonds is due to the interaction between inserted Zn2+/H+ and MVOH skeleton in different directions, weakening the force of the VO bonds. The peak of V5+=O disappears and a new broad peak (V4+=O) [37] at 843.5 cm−1 appears, indicating the valence state of V from pentavalence to tetravalence. These characteristic peaks return to initial state in fully charged state, validating the high reversibility of MVOH framework during discharge and charge. The complete Raman spectra at pristine, 1st and 2nd discharged/charged states are presented in Fig. S15. The CV curves of MVOH in 3 M Zn(OTF)2/H2O, 2.5 M Zn(OTF)2 aprotic acetonitrile electrolyte (saturated solution), 0.05 M H2SO4/H2O electrolytes (Fig. 4d–f), and 3 M ZnSO4/H2O (Fig. S17) were measured by using a three-electrode system to gain deeper insights into electrochemical behavior. Prior to CV testing, the conductivity of 3 M Zn(OTF)2/H2O, 2.5 M Zn(OTF)2/ACN, 0.05 M H2SO4/H2O and 3 M ZnSO4/H2O electrolytes (Fig. S16) was analyzed to ensure sufficient conductivity, yielding results of 0.832, 0.220, 0.972, and 1.226 S m−1, respectively. In both 3 M Zn(OTF)2/H2O electrolyte (Fig. 4d) and 3 M ZnSO4/H2O electrolyte (Fig. S17), MVOH exhibits three pairs of redox peaks. While in the 2.5 M Zn(OTF)2/ACN system (Fig. 4e), MVOH electrode shows two pairs of redox peaks. This suggests that in the Zn(OTF)2/H2O and ZnSO4/H2O electrolytes, the redox behavior at high potentials is attributed to the reversible intercalation/deintercalation of H+ in MVOH. Additionally, the CV curves of MVOH in 0.05 M H2SO4/H2O electrolyte were investigated (Fig. 4f), revealing a pair of redox peak, further confirming the reversible (de)intercalation of H+ in MVOH. Additionally, in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) tests were conducted in 3 M Zn(OTF)2 aqueous electrolyte and 2.5 M Zn(OTF)2/ACN to verify the Zn2+/H+ co-intercalation mechanism of MVOH during electrochemical process. As depicted in Fig. 4(g), the discharge capacity in acetonitrile electrolyte is still ∼110 mA h g−1, which should be contributed by Zn2+ intercalation as the H+ ions are excluded. Meantime, a counterpart battery, using 0.05 M dilute sulfuric acid with no Zn2+ ions as electrolyte and stainless steel sheet as the anode, exhibits distinct discharge platforms and discharge capacity of ∼80 mA h g−1 (Fig. S19), providing the evidence that H+ participates in reversible electrochemical process. Therefore, in Zn(OTF)2 aqueous electrolyte, the Zn2+/H+ co-intercalation mechanism can be confirmed, and the synergistic effect of Zn2+ and H+ contributes to high capacity (∼450 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1) in aqueous electrolyte, aligning with previous reports [59]. In-situ XRD (Fig. 4h–i) during the first discharge and charge process was conducted to further analyze the intercalation mechanism of Zn2+/H+ in aqueous and non-aqueous acetonitrile electrolytes. The schematic diagram is presented in Fig. 4(j) and the complete in-situ XRD patterns in aqueous and acetonitrile electrolyte are presented in Fig. S20(a and b). The highly reversible “lattice breath” during charge/discharge can be clearly inferred from the variation of (001) peak. During discharging, the interlayer spacing decreases with the intercalation of Zn2+/H+ in aqueous electrolyte, and, at the fully discharged state (0.2 V), the interlayer spacing calculated by the Bragg equation is about 9.82 Å. During the subsequent charging process, the lattice spacing can be recovered to 10.02 Å at 1.6 V. As for the intercalation in acetonitrile electrolyte, the lattice spacing at fully intercalated state is 9.52 Å. This smaller lattice spacing at discharged state in acetonitrile electrolyte can be explained by the stronger electrostatic interaction of intercalated Zn2+ alone with the VO skeletons than that of hydrated Zn ions (Zn2+/H+ co-intercation). During discharging to 0.2 V in aqueous electrolyte, the prominent peaks (black circle) at 6.6°, 13.2°, and 19.8° are attributed to Zn x +1(OTF)2 x (OH) y ·nH2O (ZTH) [60]. The relevant reaction equations can be summarized below. (3) H 2 O ↔ H + + OH - (4) Zn 2 + + x Zn OTF 2 + y OH - + n H 2 O ↔ Zn x + 1 OTF 2 x OH y · n H 2 O The insertion of H+ increases the concentrationofOH−, then OH− and Zn2+ coordinate with Zn(OTH)2 to form ZTH [61,62]. While no peak of ZTH is observed on MVOH electrode in acetonitrile electrolyte (Fig. 4i), which is reflected by SEM images (Fig. S21a and b). Plenty of ZTH nanosheets with a diameter of 15 μm (inset) are observed in aqueous electrolyte, while a flat surface (inset) is presented in acetonitrile electrolyte. The peaks (orange circle) located near 11.3°, 17.3°, 21.9°, and 25.8° show the same trend in two electrolytes, indicating the similar structural evolution and mechanism during discharging and charging, which may be mainly attributed to the effect of Zn2+. 3.5 Flexible Zn||MVOH pouch cell Lastly, the practical potential of MVOH as flexible energy device was tested, as shown in Fig. 5 (a). The pouch cell of MVOH exhibits stable capacity retention under bending angles of 0°, 90°, and 180°. As illustrated in Fig. 5(b), the overlap of voltage-capacity curves indicates the same charge–discharge mechanism under different bending angles. Practical application tests under various bending angles were conducted on a calculator, as depicted in Fig. 5(d), revealing no observed voltage decay (voltage measured in parallel with a digital multimeter). Even after puncturing and cutting, the voltage of the pouch cell remains stable, demonstrating the safety of MVOH for application in aqueous Zn-ion batteries. To evaluate the performance of the high-mass-loading MVOH cathode, a pouch cell was constructed using two pieces of zinc foils (0.05 mm thickness) as the anode, one MVOH electrode as the cathode (16.2 mg cm−2 of active material, and 4 cm × 5.5 cm area), and 3 M Zn(OTF)2 as the electrolyte. The pouch cell exhibits an capacity of 93 mAh, a unit mass capacity of 259 mA h g−1, an N/P ratio of 12.59, and a capacity retention of 91% after 45 cycles at 0.4 A g−1. 4 Conclusions In summary, monoclinic MVOH nanorods were synthesized for high-performance aqueous Zn-ion batteries. The enhanced stability of MVOH is primarily attributed to the pre-intercalated manganese ions, which serves as robust pillars to buffer “lattice breathing”. Lattice water plays a significant role in facilitating the expansion of interlayer spacing. Benefiting from the synergistic effect between Mn2+ and lattice water, MVOH exhibits high capacity of 450 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1, excellent rate performance of 170 mA h g−1 at 30 A g−1, and outstanding cycle stability for 20,000 cycles at 5 A g−1. Systematic characterization has verified the mechanism of simultaneous co–(de)intercalation of Zn2+/H+. Additionally, the pouch cell of MVOH achieves an areal capacity of 4.23 mA h cm−2 at a high loading of 16.3 mg cm−2. This work not only discusses a stable pre-intercalated cathode material, but also contributes to the understanding of the structural evolution and ion-intercalation mechanism of the vanadium oxide systems.

        "dc:description": "Aqueous Zn-ion batteries (AZIBs) are recognized as a promising energy storage system with intrinsic safety and low cost, but its applications still rely on the design of high-capacity and stable-cycling cathode materials. In this work, we present an intercalation mechanism-based cathode materials for AZIB, i.e. the vanadium oxide with pre-intercalated manganese ions and lattice water (noted as MVOH). The synergistic effect between Mn2+ and lattice H2O not only expands the interlayer spacing, but also significantly enhances the structural stability. Systematic in-situ and ex-situ characterizations clarify the Zn2+/H+ co–(de)intercalation mechanism of MVOH in aqueous electrolyte. The demonstrated remarkable structure stability, excellent kinetic behaviors and ion-storage mechanism together enable the MVOH to demonstrate satisfactory specific capacity of 450 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1, excellent rate performance of 288.8 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1 and long cycle life over 20,000 cycles at 5 A g−1. This work provides a practical cathode material, and contributes to the understanding of the ion-intercalation mechanism and structural evolution of the vanadium-based cathode for AZIBs.",
