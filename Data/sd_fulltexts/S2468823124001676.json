In recent years, photo-assisted electrocatalysis has attracted significant interest in the field of electrolytic hydrogen production. By integrating electrical and optical energy, supplementary energy is harnessed for the electrocatalytic process, which offers an efficient strategy to enhance the performance of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, the heterojunction NiO/CeO2 composite nanostructures supported by nickel foam (represented as NiO/CeO2@NF) was selected as the photo-assisted electrocatalyst, through the mutual synergy of voltage and light to improve the catalytic activity of OER in electrolytic water. Under light irradiation, the NiO component undergoes photoexcited to produce photogenerated electrons that move towards the CeO2 component, stimulating the generation and accumulation of more holes accelerating the formation of Ni (III) to improve the reaction efficiency with electrons, thereby boosting the enhancement of OER activity. The results demonstrate that the overpotential corresponding to NiO/CeO2@NF in non-irradiation at 10 mA cm−2 current density was 280 mV, and the NiO/CeO2@NF in light irradiation displays robust OER activity, with lower over-potentials 260 mV at 10 mA cm−2, which 20 mV lower than in non-irradiation. Moreover, NiO/CeO2@NF in light irradiation exhibits high catalytic activity and durability for OER in an alkaline electrolyte, delivering 100 mA cm−2 at 320 mV and outperforming RuO2 under high current densities.

Introduction The process of OER is an integral component in various renewable energy technologies, including water splitting, rechargeable metal air batteries, and the reduction of CO2. [1–4] Nevertheless, this reaction poses a kinetic disadvantage, necessitating the optimization of the anode overpotential for improved energy conversion efficiency. This entails the utilization of highly efficient electrocatalysts. [5] Existing commercial catalysts such as Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru, Au, etc., as single metals, metal oxides, and alloys are well-suited for acidic, alkaline, and other reaction conditions. [6] However, the high cost and scarcity greatly limit their widespread application in electrolysis, underscoring the urgency of identifying robust non-precious metal electrocatalysts. [7–9] A large variety of OER catalysts based on non-noble metals have been developed with high activity, due to their more stable chemical properties and good electrical conductivity when dissolved in water, and can be further optimized to improve their electrical transport and catalytic properties specifically for water oxidation. [10–12] In recent years, transition-metal based oxides, hydroxides, phosphides and sulfides have attracted great attention due to their promising OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) properties. [13–18] The field of photo-assisted electrocatalysis represents a novel methodology that builds upon traditional electrocatalysis, offering a broader range of energy conversion pathways during the reaction process and facilitating more efficient reaction kinetics. [19,20] The photo-generated carriers from light-responsive electrocatalysts can directly participate in redox reactions, which can significantly reduce the energy barrier and overpotential of catalysts. [21–24] Albu Z et al. proposed a method to improve the performance of OER by designing metal oxide/metal oxide (MO/MO) nanoparticles with n-type and p-type characteristics using binary MO materials. [25] In this study, a variety of CeO2/Co3O4 nanoparticles were prepared via the sol-gel method for comparative analysis. The initial potential and photoactivity of the heterogeneous interface of MO/MO nanoparticles were found to be significantly higher than those of individual metal oxides. Furthermore, the optical properties of the material were investigated following light exposure, resulting in enhanced catalytic performance in the n-CeO2/p-MO system, wherein electrons were transferred from the MO nanoparticles to the conduction band of CeO2 under light irradiation. Han X et al. based on heterojunction materials of transition MO and semiconductors, a bifunctional catalyst for enhancing OER and HER was proposed by using a photogenerated carrier drive strategy. [26] Transition metal oxides can improve OER performance by improving their active sites by utilizing photogenerated carrier and hole transfer. The Ni/NiO heterostructure ultrathin nanosheet array (Ni/NiONF) fabricated on NF was employes as a bifunctional electrocatalyst, which exhibited 10 times higher mass activity for HER and 2.6 times higher mass activity for OER after light exposure. Previously, CeO2 has been utilized to enhance the OER. [27,28] CeO2/ RuO2 and the hybrid CeO2-RrO2-IrO2 exhibit superior OER performance compared to pure RuO2 and IrO2 counterparts. [29,30] Notably, the high-valence state of Ce4+ generates oxygen vacancies that effectively neutralize structural charges. In an alkaline medium, nickel-based catalysts undergo self-oxidation during the OER process, with Ni (III) being considered as the active site for OER. [26] Herein, the p-n NiO and CeO2 heterojunction fabricated on NF (NiO/CeO2@NF) was prepared as an efficient catalyst for OER. By modulating the band gap of the heterojunction interface, the electron transfer rate during photo-assisted electrocatalysis can be significantly enhanced, leading to improved overall efficiency. Moreover, under illumination conditions, photogenerated electrons generated by NiO were efficiently transferred to CeO2, facilitating hole accumulation within NiO and promoting its transformation into high-valent Ni species (Ni III). This redox property enhancement further reduced OER overpotential and enhanced catalytic performance. Experimental sections The NF is gained from NF Solutions, Inc. Nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni (NO3)2. 6H2O, 98 %), Cerium nitrate hexahydrate (Ce (NO3)3 · 6H2O, 99.5 %), Hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37 %) and urea (CH4N2O, 99.5 %) are from Macklin. The deionized water for solution preparation is from an Autopure system (18.3 MΩ/cm, Millipore Ltd, USA). Synthesis of NiO/CeO2@NF composite material Base NF treatment steps: Firstly, cut the NF into a rectangular shape of about 1 × 2 cm2 for use. The NF substrates were cleaned by ultrasound in 3 mol/L HCl solution for 35 min to clean up organic matter and oxides. Then, wash with deionized water. The NF substrate was sonicated in acetone solution for 35 min. Finally, the NF substrates were cleaned by ultrasound in deionized water for 35 min. Drying of samples in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 8 h. NiO/CeO2@NF was synthesized with slight modifications based on the method of reference. [31] Initially, 363 mg of Ni (NO3)2·6H2O (1.25 mmol), 271 mg Ce (NO3)3·6H2O (0.625 mmol), and 75 mg urea (1.25 mmol) was added into 50 mL deionized water, magnetic stirred at 25 °C for 20 min. Then, the treated NF was transferred to 100 mL autoclave, simultaneously transfer the precursor solution to a autoclave. Placed in an oven and heated at 60 °C for 8 h. After waiting for it to cool to 25 °C. The precipitated and NF was collected, multiple washed with ethanol and deionized water, and placed in an oven and heated at 60 °C for 8 h. Finally, preparation of samples annealed at 300 °C in the air for 2 h for subsequent electrochemical testing and investigating materials characterization. Then, the NiO/CeO2 heterojunction was called NiO/CeO2@NF. Synthesis of NiO@NF and CeO2@NF Required amounts of Ni (NO3)2·6H2O or Ce (NO3)3·6H2O and 75 mg urea(1.25 mmol) were added into 50 mL deionized water, which were sufficiently stirred at 25 °C to get a clear solution. Then, added the treated NF was transferred to 100 mL autoclave, simultaneously transfer the precursor solution to autoclave. Placed in the oven at 120 °C for 6 h. After waiting for it to cool to 25 °C. The precipitated and NF was collected, multiple washed with ethanol and deionized water, and placed in an oven and heated at 60 °C for 8 h. Finally, the products were annealed at 300 °C in air for 2 h for subsequent electrochemical testing and investigating materials characterization. Characterizations Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, ZEISS Sigma 300 Germany) and the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) were conducted on an FEI Talos 200S, FEI operated at 200 kV. The morphology and crystal structure of the material were characterized. Acquired materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker, D8 ADVANCE). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific K-Alpha, USA) showed elemental composition and electronic structure in prepared samples. Electrochemical measurements As shown in Fig. S1, CeO2@NF, NiO@NF, and NiO/CeO2@NF, the electrochemical performance test was conducted using a CHI 760E electrochemical workstation (Shanghai, China), and equipped with a 300 W Xenon lamp (Beijing, China, PLS-SXE300D). A three-electrode electrolytic cell was used, with NiO/CeO2@NF as the working electrode, platinum as the auxiliary electrode, and a saturated Hg/HgO electrode as the reference electrode. Before the experiment, pure argon gas was passed into the electrolyte cell for 25 min to maintain a saturated vapor pressure. Throughout the experiment, maintain the low flow rate of process argon gas. Before the electrochemical test, activation of the working electrode using cyclic voltammetry (CV) until stabilization. The scanning rates of CV and linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) are both 1 mV/s. Using slow scanning for LSV can minimize capacitive current, making the measured OER current curve more reliable. All potentialities were used: E ( V vs RHE ) = E ( V vs Hg/HgO ) + E θ ( Hg / HgO ) + 0.059 * pH − iR ,conversion to reversible hydrogen electrode reference standard. The Tafel slope can be calculated using the following equation: η = blogj + a , where j is the current density, and b is the Tafel slope. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data were measured by an electrochemical workstation, the open circuit potential in the frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 102 kHz. The OER test data was corrected by iR compensation. All curves were iR compensated with the following equations: EiR- corrected = E-iR. The stability of the material was also obtained through its testing on an electrochemical workstation. Optical AIDS for electrochemical testing of materials, the 300 W Xenon lamp light source was used to illuminate 15 cm from the surface of the sample, and the illumination area is 1 cm2. The influence of the illumination on the performance was explored. The effect of light on the performance of the OER was tested at 1.62 V (vs RHE) potential. Utilizes platinum sheet as counter electrode and Hg/HgO electrode was used as the reference electrode. Other parameters were similar to electrochemistry. Results and discussion Characterization of electrocatalysts The composite precursor solution was introduced into the reactor, subsequent to heating a 120 °C for 6 h, followed by annealing for 2 h. SEM analysis in Fig. 1 (a) and Fig. S2 (a), the morphology of pure NiO forms a coral-like network through the interconnected nanosheets, creating a layered porous nanostructure. As shown in Fig. S2 (b) CeO2 has a smooth surface. Upon the incorporation of cerium, the nanoflakes began to aggregate. HRTEM analysis in Fig. 1(b) showed that the main crystal structure composition of these nanosheets were CeO2 and NiO. As obviously, the lattice spacing of the two different crystal faces were 0.313 nm and 0.24 nm, and there well indexed to the (1, 1, 1) and (1, 1, 1) planes of CeO2 and NiO, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1(c), the corresponding diffraction ring was also found on the mapping. The heterojunction region of NiO and CeO2 (indicated by red dashed lines) can be observed. As shown in Fig. 1(d), we can see that all the elements are evenly distributed on the outer surface of the material. The XRD patterns observed for the NiO/CeO2 products were shown in Fig. 2 , the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 28.6°, 33.1°, 47.5° and 56.3° correspond to (1, 1, 1), (2, 0, 0), (2, 2, 0), and (3, 1, 1) plane of CeO2 (PDF#43–1002), respectively. In addition, all the diffraction peaks match the (PDF# 47–1049) NiO with typical peaks at 37.4°, 43.5°, 63.2° and 75.4° can be assigned to (1, 1, 1), (2, 0, 0), (2 2 0), (3, 1, 1) reflections, respectively. The reason why the diffraction peak of NiO was not obvious in XRD may be due to its poor crystallization and the excessive peak of NF diffraction. Further study on the elemental combinations and corresponding valence states of the prepared materials using XPS. All elemental spectral data were calibrated by the C 1 s peak at 284.8 eV. [32] As described in Fig. 3 (a-b) and Fig. S3, shows the high-resolution spectra of Ce 3d, Ni 2p and O 1 s, respectively. This result proves that there were no impurities in the prepared material other than the required elements. Fig. 3(a) shows the binding energies of 882.18 eV, 888.68 eV, and 898.18 eV belonging to Ce 3d5/2, while the binding energies of 900.58 eV, 907.48 eV, and 916.48 eV were ascribed to Ce 3d3/2. These binding energies correspond to the Ce (Ce3+ and Ce 4+). [33] It can be observed that when NiO was combined with CeO2, the binding energy of Ce was shifted to a lower direction, indicating that CeO2 has the effect of attracting electrons after the combination. In the spectrum in XPS on Ni (Fig. 3b), a satellite peak (designated as 'Sat.') was observed. 854.9 eV and 872.8 eV correspond to the binding energies of Ni2+ 2p3/2 and Ni2+ 2p1/2, respectively, 856.3 eV and 874.6 eV correspond to the binding energy fraction of Ni3+ 2p3/2 and Ni3+ 2p1/2, agree with the characteristics of Ni3+. [34] In comparison with the binding energies of different valence states of Ni in NiO, it can be observed that the binding energy corresponding to Ni has shifted to a higher place after the combination of NiO and CeO2, indicating that there were inter-electronic interaction forces in the prepared material. Fig. S3, illustrates two O 1 s peaks. The peaks at 529.5 eV were the mental-oxygen bonding called O I, and whereas the O Ⅱ peak at 531.6 eV was designated with the defective oxygen on the surface. [35] These characterizations further demonstrate the successful preparation of NiO/CeO2 heterojunction materials and the coupling between NiO and CeO2, which promotes electron transfer and structural modulation of electrons. When under light irradiation, the heterojunction promotes photogenerated carrier transfer, and the holes accumulated on the material can improve the performance of OER electrocatalysis. It has been reported that NiO exhibits p-type semiconductor behavior, while CeO2 behaves as an n-type semiconductor. The impedance spectrum analysis at an AC frequency of 10 kHz revealed an inverted \"v\" shape in the Mott-Schottky (M-S) plot shown in Fig. 4 (c), confirming the formation of a heterojunction between the prepared materials. UV–vis DRS spectra in Fig. 4(a) demonstrated that the addition of NiO enhances the light absorption capability of CeO2, resulting in good absorptive capacity for NiO@NF, CeO2@NF, and NiO/CeO2@NF within the visible range with absorption edges around 350 nm. Furthermore, as depicted in Fig. 4(b), calculated band gaps were determined to be 2.01 eV, 2.27 eV, and 3.19 eV for NiO@NF, CeO2@NF, and NiO/CeO2@NF, respectively. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that this fabricated heterojunction material effectively reduces the band gap energy requirement for electron transition from valence to conduction bands, and while facilitating electron transfer processes. Consequently, this material exhibits improved light response range and intensity which significantly promotes photo-assisted electrocatalytic processes. Electrochemical analysis The electrocatalytic OER activitiy of the prepared material was tested by the CHI 760E electrochemical workstation. NiO/CeO2@NF electrochemical testing used a three-electrode electrolytic cell system at 25 °C, and NiO/CeO2@NF were evaluated in an Ar-saturated 1 M KOH solution. Before the test, the material needs to be tested using CV at 1 mV/s until its properties were stable. Then the material was tested by LSV. As shown in Fig. 5 (a), the LSV curve of the test sample was corrected by iR-correction. The experimental comparison diagram was shown that other conditions are the same except for light irradiation and non-irradiation. At 25 °C, the overpotential corresponding to NiO/CeO2@NF (Dark) at 10 mA cm−2 current density was 280 mV, NiO/CeO2@NF (Dark) was lower than NiO and CeO2 overpotential under the same conditions, this is mainly due to the mutual coupling of electrons between NiO and CeO2, which promotes electron transfer. And the NiO/CeO2@NF (Light) with 300 W Xenon lamp shows good OER activity, and its overpotential was as low as 260 mV at 10 mA cm−2, which's 20 mV lower than the overpotential in the dark, and 295 mV at 50 mA cm−2, when the OER current density was 100 mA cm−2, the overpotential was 320 mV, the OER performance was obviously improved. Tafel slope is another important criterion for evaluating catalytic activity. Achieve the required energy by reducing the barrier. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the Tafel slope conforms to LSV, the Tafel slope of NiO/CeO2@NF was minimized in comparison with the pure phase material under the same conditions. Moreover, the Tafel slope of the composite material changed greatly after light transmission. The results shows that light-driven semiconductor excitation can promote the increase of water reduction power on the NiO/CeO2 working electrode surface, and thus increase the reaction rate. Details of the performance of this paper in comparison with other experimental work can be found at Supporting Information Table. S2. Through the analysis of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), the reaction principle can be further explained. There is a relationship between the semicircular loop in the Nyquist diagram at high frequencies and the charge transfer resistance between the electrode and electrolyte interface, while the slope at low frequencies is related to diffusion. [36] As shown in Fig.6 (a), typical Nyquist plots of these samples were depicted. NiO/CeO2@NF (Light) has an Rct value of only 4.5 Ω, the Rct values of both pure phase materials were greater than those of composite materials, and NiO/CeO2@NF (Dark). The lower Rct value leads to a faster electron transfer rate and enhanced OER activity. The combination of EIS and Tafel slope table NiO/CeO2@NF heterojunction improved the electron transfer rate, as well as the catalytic kinetics in the reaction. In addition to activity evaluations, as shown in Fig. 6(b), chronoamperometric and expedited duration examinations were executed to assess the catalytic durability. We operated the OER at an overpotential of 370 mV for NiO/CeO2@NF shows 98.2 % and 94.1 % current retention after 10 h under light irradiation and non-irradiation, respectively. The activity of a general catalyst is proportional to its electrochemical active surface area (ECSA). ECSA can be estimated by double-layer capacitance (Cdl) at the solid-liquid interface. In Fig. S4 (a-f), according to 20∼160 mV/s of CV curves in the potential interval of 0.902 V ∼ 1.052 V (vs. RHE) at various scan rates, by calculating the current density difference of the center point under different sweep numbers as the ordinate coordinate and the scanning rate as the abscissa coordinate. In Fig. S4 (g), and Table. S1, NiO/CeO2@NF has the highest ECSA of 183.75 cm2 than CeO2 (ECSA = 94.25 cm2) and NiO (ECSA = 143 cm2) in the absence of light. This mainly results from the exposure of active sites on the NiO. Under light irradiation, the highest ECSA was still NiO/CeO2@NF, which demonstrates that it may be due to the fact that light increases the active site thereby increasing the catalyst activity. Conclusion In summary, NiO/CeO2 heterostructures were facilely synthesized via hydrothermal method on a NF substrate. The resulting NiO/CeO2@NF exhibited remarkable catalytic performance in activating the OER. The light-activated NiO component, generating photogenerated holes, acts as a driving force for the oxidation of non-active Ni (II) to Ni (III), thereby significantly enhancing OER activity in electrolytic water. Under light irradiation, the overpotential required for a current density of 10 mA cm−2 was merely 260 mV, and even at elevated current densities of 50 mA cm−2 and 100 mA cm−2, the corresponding overpotentials remain within the range of 295 mV and 320 mV respectively, ranking among the top-performing catalysts based on NiO/CeO2 (Table S2). These results provide insights into structural design and materials synthesis of photo-assisted OER electrocatalysts.

        "dc:description": "In recent years, photo-assisted electrocatalysis has attracted significant interest in the field of electrolytic hydrogen production. By integrating electrical and optical energy, supplementary energy is harnessed for the electrocatalytic process, which offers an efficient strategy to enhance the performance of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, the heterojunction NiO/CeO2 composite nanostructures supported by nickel foam (represented as NiO/CeO2@NF) was selected as the photo-assisted electrocatalyst, through the mutual synergy of voltage and light to improve the catalytic activity of OER in electrolytic water. Under light irradiation, the NiO component undergoes photoexcited to produce photogenerated electrons that move towards the CeO2 component, stimulating the generation and accumulation of more holes accelerating the formation of Ni (III) to improve the reaction efficiency with electrons, thereby boosting the enhancement of OER activity. The results demonstrate that the overpotential corresponding to NiO/CeO2@NF in non-irradiation at 10 mA cm−2 current density was 280 mV, and the NiO/CeO2@NF in light irradiation displays robust OER activity, with lower over-potentials 260 mV at 10 mA cm−2, which 20 mV lower than in non-irradiation. Moreover, NiO/CeO2@NF in light irradiation exhibits high catalytic activity and durability for OER in an alkaline electrolyte, delivering 100 mA cm−2 at 320 mV and outperforming RuO2 under high current densities.",
