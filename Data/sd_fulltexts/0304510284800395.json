SPECIFIC ROLE OF MOLYBDENUM IN HYDROCARBON ADSORPTION AND CONVERSION T. M. TRI1', J. MASSARDIER, P. GALLEZOT* and B. IMELIK Institut de Recherches sur la Catalyse, CNRS, 2 av. Albert Einstein, 69626 Villeurbanne, Cedex (France) Summary Pt Mo bimetallic catalysts prepared by adsorption and decomposition of Mo(CO)e on 1 nm Pt aggregates supported on Y-zeolite exhibit enhanced hydrogenolysis activity in n-butane conversion. This is due to the participa- tion of Mo atoms in the reaction mechanism. The TPD of adsorbed ethane and TP surface reaction of D2 with the hydrocarbon fragments show that the saturated hydrocarbons are strongly dissociated on the Mo atoms, which accounts for the hydrogenolysis enhancement. On the other hand, benzene hydrogenation proceeds only on the fraction of platinum not covered by Mo atoms; the catalytic activity and the t^ chemisorption decrease simulta- neously. Pt Mo Y catalysts exhibit a higher resistance to sulfur poisoning, but the poisoning is irreversible. Introduction The preparation and characterization of zeolite-supported Pt Mo bimetallic catalysts have been reported in a previous paper [1]. It was con- cluded that a portion of the Mo atoms freed by the decomposition of Mo(CO)6 are deposited on the surface of 1 nm platinum aggregates fitting in the zeolite supercages. In a subsequent paper [2] it was shown that Pt Mo Y catalysts exhibit enhanced hydrogenolysis activity in n-butane conversion with respect to Pt Y catalysts. The kinetic parameters were interpreted in terms of the participation in the reaction mechanism of both Pt and Mo atoms associated in the aggregates. It was assumed that Mo atoms act primarily as adsorption sites for the hydrocarbon, while hydrogen dis- sociated on Pt atoms hydrogenates the hydrocarbon fragments. In this work, the adsorption properties of Pt Mo catalysts have been studied to confirm that saturated hydrocarbons are more strongly adsorbed \" \"Present address: Laboratory for Catalysis and Petrochemistry, I-Mac Dinh Chi, Ho- Chi-Minh City, Vietnam. *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/84/$3.00 Elsevier Sequoia/Printed in The Netherlands 152 and dissociated on Pt Mo aggregates than on Pt aggregates. Sulfur poisoning and regeneration experiments, as well as measurements of the rate of benzene hydrogenation, were also undertaken to document the previously assumed dual-site mechanism of n-butane conversion. Experimental The preparation and characterization of catalysts were described in Part I of this series [1]. The composition and nomenclature of the samples are given in Table 1.

Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and temperature- programmed surface reaction (TPSR) of adsorbed hydrocarbon fragments with Ha or D; have been performed in an ultra-high vacuum system including an oil diffusion pump, a liquid nitrogen trap (V.G.) and a mass spectrometer (ultimate pressure 5 X ICT10 torr). Samples were treated in a quartz cell with a temperature-programmed furnace. The standard heating rate was 30 K min\"1. Measurements of the rates of n-butane reaction were described in Part II of this series [2]. Those of the rates of benzene hydrogenation were carried out in a differential flow reactor at low conversion, as described previously [3]. Sulfur poisoning experiments were performed by contacting the catalyst at 300 K with 5 cm3 pulses of 1000 ppm of H^S diluted in Hi. Results TPD of CiHf, and TPSR with H^ or D^ The study of the adsorption of saturated hydrocarbons has been per- formed with CaHg to make the thermal desorption and surface reaction 153 analyses easier. Samples Pt NaHY and Pt Mo Y were heated at 600 K under 100 torr of H2 and outgassed at 700 K for 1 h. Ethane was adsorbed at 300 K under 50 torr pressure, and then the catalysts were evacuated at 300 K. The TPD was performed between 300 and 770 K at 30 K min-1. The TPD curves corresponding to the desorption of mass 30 species (molecular ethane) are shown in Fig. 1. The TPD curves corresponding to mass 2 (molecular hydrogen formed by CzHg dehydrogenation) are shown in Fig. 2. The TPD curves of H^ adsorbed on clean samples under 100 torr pressure during heating from 300 to 600 K and cooling from 600 to 300 K, are given for comparison in Fig. 3.

Sul'fur poisoning and regeneration experiments The resistance of Pt NaHY and Pt Mo Y-II to sulfur poisoning was measured during n-butane conversion at 600 K. The hydrogenolysis reaction rates were measured before and after each increment of H;S diluted in H;. The sulfur adsorption on Pt aggregates in Y-zeolites has been monitored previously by the shift of the v(CO) frequency of CO adsorbed at low coverage [3]. The ratios Vu/V^ of the total hydrogenolysis rates after and before poisoning by successive increments of H^S are given in Fig. 6. The units on the x-axis were calculated by assuming that the entire amount of H^S is taken up either by Pt atoms or by Pt + Mo atoms. This is a crude approximation, because some of the HyS molecules could also be adsorbed on the zeolite support. Regeneration experiments were performed on Pt NaHY and Pt Mo Y-II contacted with twice the amount of H^S required to completely poison the catalyst. The percentages of regeneration of the hydrogenolysis activity after heating in flowing Hz for 1 h at increasingly higher tempera- tures are given in Table 3. Discussion The physical state of the Pt Mo bimetallic catalysts supported on Y- zeolite has been discussed in detail in previous work [1, 2]. Let us recall that upon decomposition of Mo(CO)g adsorbed in a Y-zeolite containing 1 nm Pt aggregates in the supercages, a fraction of the Mo atoms is deposited on the 157 TABLE 3 Percentage of hydrogenolysis activity regenerated after Ha treatment at increasing temperatures Samples Temperature of regeneration (K) 570 670 770 870 Pt NaHY 0 0.1 9.2 32 (Pt + Mo)Y-II O 0 0.7 0.8 Pt/Si02 0 0 2.8 - Pt aggregates, probably on the surface facing the 0.75 nm diameter cage apertures. This deposition hinders the H; chemisorption at room tempera- ture and suppresses the electrophilic character of platinum. The kinetic parameters of n-butane conversion, especially the positive reaction orders with respect to the hydrocarbon and hydrogen pressures, have been inter- preted by a mechanism involving the participation of the Mo and Pt atoms, the former acting essentially as adsorption sites for the hydrocarbon, whereas the latter yielding dissociated hydrogen required to hydrogenate the hydro- carbon fragments on molybdenum. The role of the Mo atoms is supported by the following discussion. Chemisorption of hydrocarbons on molybdenum The TPD of ethane (Fig. 1) shows that ethane in the molecular form desorbs less easily from Pt Mo Y-III than from Pt NaHY, since the maxi- mum of the TPD peak is shifted upwards by 50 K. The TPD of hydrogen formed by dehydrogenation of CaHg adsorbed on Pt Mo Y-III exhibits a high-temperature desorption peak which is not present in Pt NaHY (Fig. 2). This could mean either that the dehydrogenation of C2H6 occurs at a higher temperature on Pt Mo Y-III or that the hydrogen formed remains adsorbed on the catalyst up to 650 - 700 K. The second hypothesis can be accepted because of the similarity between the TPD of H^ evolved from CaHg decom- position (Fig. 2) and the TPD of H2 adsorbed on a clean Pt Mo Y-ni sample within the 300 - 600 K temperature range (Fig. 3). The high-tempera- ture desorption peak present in both samples is probably due to adsorbed hydrogen atoms encapsulated between the cage wall and the aggregate sur- face due to the deposition of Mo atoms on the cage apertures. Because of this hydrogen retention, it is not possible to determine the temperature at which the CaHg dehydrogenation occurs and therefore to identify any differ- ence in the temperature of CzHg dehydrogenation with respect to Pt NaHY. Since hydrogen is evolved from the catalyst during the TPD experiment, hydrocarbon fragments are left on the surface. Indeed, TPSR with H; or Da shows that these species are hydrogenated into methane or deuterometh- ane. On Pt Mo Y-III the reaction yield is maximum at 470 K, compared to 420 K on Pt NaHY (Fig. 4), which indicates either that the hydrocarbon 158 Fig. 6.

(Pt + Mo); (0) Pt-NaHY. fragments are less easily hydrogenated on Pt Mo Y-III or that the CH4 molecules formed are less easily desorbed from Pt Mo Y-III. The TPSR with D; is more informative. The temperature of the maximum deutero- methane yield is also shifted upwards by 50 K on Pt Mo Y-ni with respect to Pt NaHY. Moreover the isotopic composition of the products is quite different; Table 2 shows that the deuteromethane formed on Pt Mo Y-III contains more deuterium atoms than that formed on Pt NaHY. The hydro- carbon fragments are therefore more strongly dehydrogenated on Pt Mo Y- III than on Pt NaHY; indeed, the metal surface is essentially covered by carbon and CH groups. These experiments show that the addition of Mo atoms onto the platinum aggregates provides new adsorption sites capable of holding and dissociating hydrocarbon more strongly than do platinum atoms. n-Butane hydrogenolysis and benzene hydrogenation As discussed in a previous paper [2], the turnover frequency of n- butane hydrogenolysis n(Pt + Mo) exhibits a maximum when there is an optimum concentration of Mo atoms and Pt atoms available to dissociate n-butane and hydrogen respectively (Fig. 5, curve a). In contrast, the turn- over frequency n(Pt + Mo) of benzene hydrogenation decreases continuously as more and more Mo atoms are added to the platinum aggregates. Therefore the Mo atoms are not active sites for CgHg hydrogenation, and even hinder the catalytic activity of platinum because the aggregate surface is less and less accessible to CgHg molecules. The turnover frequency n(Pt) (Fig. 5, curve d) is consistently almost constant when Mo is added, which means that only the platinum atoms not covered by Mo are the active sites for CsHg hydrogenation. These results support the model of Pt Mo aggregates in which the Mo atoms cover the Pt aggregates. They also support, a contrario, the mechanism of n-butane hydrogenolysis involving both Mo and Pt atoms as active sites, since otherwise the turnover frequencies n(Pt) and n(Pt + Mo) for n-butane hydrogenolysis and benzene hydrogenation would exhibit a similar change with Pt/Mo composition. 159 Sulfur poisoning and regeneration The poisoning curves of Pt NaHY and Pt Mo Y-II given in Fig. 6 are quite different. The Pt Mo catalyst appears more sulfur-resistant, since the initial slope of the poisoning curve is smaller than that of Pt NaHY and the amount of sulfur required to completely poison the catalyst is larger. This can be attributed to the addition of molybdenum. In particular, the fraction of Mo atoms deposited on the support but not interacting with platinum can trap part of the H;S without any loss of catalytic activity. Moreover, the carbidic species formed on the Mo atoms covering the Pt aggregates should be quite stable and less prone to sulfidation than platinum or clean molybdenum. Indeed, Smutek and Cemy [4] have reported that the association of one carbon atom with two molybdenum atoms has a binding energy as high as 736 kJ mol\"1. Pt Mo Y-II is more resistant to sulfur poisoning than is Pt NaHY, since its activity drops less rapidly upon HaS injection, but paradoxically, its activity is difficult to regenerate after complete sulfur poisoning. The per- centage of regeneration given in Table 3 indicates that Pt NaHY activity is more easily regenerated than Pt/SiO;, in agreement with previous findings [3]. This is attributed to the electrophilic character of the Pt aggregates, which should result in weaker Pt S bonding. On the other hand, the inabil- ity to regenerate Pt MoY activity can be explained in two ways: (i) Once the molybdenum atoms are sulfided, the stability of the Mo S bond pre- vents the regeneration of activity in the temperature range investigated. The binding energy of sulfur on the Mo surface is actually larger than on the Pt surface [5]. (ii) Platinum atoms initially shielded by Mo atoms can also be poisoned upon prolonged exposure to high HaS doses. Platinum associated with molybdenum is then no longer electrophilic, as shown in our previous work [I], and therefore its regeneration is much more difficult than that of electrophilic aggregates in Pt NaHY. Conclusions The results reported in this paper support the previous conclusion regarding the physical state of bimetallic Pt Mo aggregates in Y-zeolite. Thus the decrease in activity during benzene hydrogenation which parallels the decrease in H; chemisorption can only be explained by the deposition of Mo atoms which mask the Pt atoms underneath. The participation of Mo atoms as strong adsorption sites for hydrocarbons in n-butane conversion is also clearly demonstrated by TPD and TPSR studies, which show that highly dissociated hydrocarbon species are formed on Pt Mo Y catalysts and account for their enhanced hydrogenolysis activity. Poisoning and regenera- tion experiments show that the addition of molybdenum to platinum increases the sulfur resistance, but the poisoning is irreversible. These experi- ments do not provide additional proof for the dual-site mechanism, because both the platinum atoms responsible for H2 chemisorption and the molyb- denum atoms responsible for hydrocarbon chemisorption are poisoned. 160 References 1 T.
