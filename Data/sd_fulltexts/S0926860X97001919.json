Brazdil*, Ann M. Ebner, Fernando A.R Cavalcanti BP Chemicals Inc., 4440 Warrensville Center Road, Cleveland OH 44128, USA Received 24 February 1997; received in revised form 16 May 1997: accepted 17 May 1997 Abstract This paper describes a new class of vanadium containing oxide catalysts that are active and selective for the selective catalytic reduction of NO with ammonia. Vanadium antimony oxide based catalysts were found to be effective in the conversion of NO with little or no ammonia slippage when tested using gas mixtures containing between 300 and 700 ppm NO. X-ray diffraction analyses of the catalysts show that the dominant phase present in the catalyst is vanadium antimonate having a defect rutile crystal structure. The catalysts are active and selective in the ranges of 400-460 and gas hourly space velocities of 3000-8000 h-1. 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.
