FTIR results show that the sol-gel catalysts present higher hydroxylation as compared with impregnated ones. The features of the IR spectra are explained as the treatment temperature increases. In the preparation process of traditional impregnated catalysts much Mg (OH) 2 is formed which is later transformed into MgO by thermal treatment. BET areas are very similar for both types of catalysts. Theoretical semi-empirical Extended Huckel (EH) and self-consistent field (SCF) calculations were performed on Li/MgO model clusters to test the existence of [ Li+O- ] sites and oxygen vacancies. The EH calculations were done with Li concentrations varying from 2.66 to 15.9 wt.%. Results show a trend towards the formation of [Li+0- ] centers when Li concentration increases. This concentration effect is in agreement with the experimental results of methane activation. The SCF calculations using minimal and extended gaussian basis sets were performed on pure MgO and Li/MgO model clusters. These SCF results also show the creation of [Li+O-] sites which could explain the abstraction of hydrogen in the oxidative coupling of methane over Li/ MgO catalysts. Key words: lithium; magnesia; sol-gel catalysts Introduction Natural gas is a resource which should not be wasted as it is presently done in most petroleum drilling sites. Methane is the natural raw material from which many industrial products can be obtained. For this reason, recently, much effort has been devoted to design efficient catalytic processes in which the C-H bond (which requires 104 kcal/mol to be broken under normal conditions) is activated producing the CH3 radical. From these CH3 molecules many reaction routes can be followed that lead to methanol, formaldehyde, *Corresponding author; fax. ( + 52-5) 6161535.

Catal. 88 (1994) 71-84 ethylene, ethane or higher hydrocarbons. Liu et al. [ 1 ] have experimentally determined that the CH3 radicals constitute an integral part of these reactions and therefore hydrogen abstraction from methane becomes a critical step. From the experimental point of view, an interesting survey was done more than ten years ago [2]; this work tested a series of metal oxides that would promote the formation of methyl radicals into the gas phase from methane. The metal oxides that were examined included Si02, Bi203, A1203 and Mg0 which was, by far, the most active. A perfect MgO network would be expected to be inert. Nevertheless, Mg0 crystals contain a large amount of defects such as ionic impurities and vacancies. Besides this, the high surface area oxide contains sites of low coordination, namely, edges and corners. The remarkable catalytic activity of MgO for butene isomerization [ 3 ] and H2-D2 exchange [4] has been attributed to oxygen ions at low-coordination sites. On the other hand, Driscoll et al. [5] and Ito et al. [6,7] found that lithium-doped magnesium oxide was a highly selective catalyst and proposed a mechanism in which [Li+0-] species are the active sites responsible for the formation of CH3 radicals in the oxidative coupling of methane. These [ Li +0- ] sites would initiate the reaction by abstracting a hydrogen atom from CH4. It is widely accepted that the hydrogen abstraction step takes place over one oxygen ion site in the lattice, although a very recent study [ 8 ] of the partial oxidation of methane over a model MgO catalyst prepared under well-controlled ultra-high vacuum conditions indicates that [Li+0- ] centers are not likely to be directly involved in the hydrogen-abstraction step but that they promote the formation of color (F) centers near the surface of the catalyst which are responsible for this key step in the methane coupling reaction. Many other experimental studies have been carried out involving the oxidative coupling of methane over Li/MgO catalysts ( [9,10] and references therein). The activity and selectivity of Li/MgO catalysts seems to depend on the number of [ Li +0- ] sites formed during their preparation. Li-doped magnesia catalysts were usually prepared by wet impregnation of the magnesia support with lithium salt. The substitution of a Mg ion by a Li ion depends then on the hydrolysis of MgO during the impregnation step. An improvement in selectivity is observed when the lithium ion is added to a Mg (OH), precursor [ 11 ] . In the present work a promising alternative is reported: the Li/MgO catalysts were prepared by the homogenous hydrolysis of magnesium alkoxide in a solution containing ethanol, water and LiCl, i.e. the sol-gel method [ 12 ] . From the theoretical point of view there have not been as many works. Deprick and Julg [ 13 ] studied the adsorption of methane on (100) faces of pure MgO using the SCF method completed for the dispersion-repulsion term by an adapted pair potential. Mehandru et al. [ 14 ] used the atom superposition and electron delocalization molecular orbital method (ASED-MO) to predict structures, binding energies and electronic properties of the C-H bond break- T. Lopez et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 88 (1994) 71-84 73 ing process over Li/MgO catalysts. They used an (Mg21020)2+ cluster in their calculations. Zicovich-Wilson et al. [ 15 ] performed SCF-UHF calculations on a linear model MgO2X2 cluster (where X is a pseudoatom having the valence atomic orbitals of magnesium and a single electron) to study the oxidative coupling of methane over pure magnesium oxide and concluded that in this process a methyl radical is formed with an estimated energy barrier of 50 kcal/mol. In a later study, this group [ 16 ] reported semi-empirical (Extended HUM) studies on the oxidative coupling of methane over pure MgO and MgO doped with Li and Na. Finally, Borve and Petersson have reported two very interesting theoretical works. In the first one [ 17 ] they performed SCF, CASSCF and multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) calculations to study hydrogen abstraction from methane using a single MgO molecule. Their second study is more realistic and can be related to the catalytic process which is our concern here. In this work [ 18 ] they performed SCF, CASSCF and MRCI calculations to study hydrogen abstraction from methane using a reduced cluster embedded in a point-charge array to simulate the rest of the crystalline lattice intended to model the (001) surface of pure and Li-, Na-, Be- and Al-doped MgO. Their largest model cluster contained 11 atoms and hydrogen abstraction was restricted to occur in the colinear M (metal)-H-C direction. However, these authors never address the question of the existence of [Li+10-1 ] sites nor did they study the effect of Li concentration upon charge distribution near these supposedly \"active\" centers. In this work we present the experimental characterization (using FTIR studies and BET areas) of lithium-doped MgO catalysts that have been prepared using the sol-gel method. We also report the activity and selectivity results for the oxidative coupling of methane over traditionally impregnated and sol-gel Li/MgO catalysts. In order to test the [Li+O- ] site hypothesis in Li/MgO catalysts theoretical semi-empirical Extended Huckel (EH) and self-consistent field (SCF ) calculations were performed on pure MgO and Li/MgO model clusters. From the results of these calculations we discuss the effect of lithium concentration upon the charge of neighboring oxygen atoms as well as charge distribution on these model MgO and Li/MgO clusters. It is clear that these calculations cannot reveal whether the [Li+0- ] sites are actually responsible for the hydrogen abstraction step from methane or if these sites are only involved in the formation of near-surface F centers (as has been recently proposed [8]) which could be directly linked to the removal of a hydrogen atom from methane. The purpose of the theoretical calculations reported here is two-fold. Firstly, we intend to analyse the presence of [Li+10-1 ] sites through self-consistent field charge population Mulliken analyses; these centers have long been postulated but, to the best of our knowledge, no theoretical calculations to test this hypothesis have ever been done before. Secondly, one would naturally want to know the effect of lithium concentration upon the charge distribution of these 74 T. Lopex et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 88 (1994) 71-84 sites; this subject has been addressed here through the semi-empirical EH calculations. Experimental Synthesis of Li/MgO sol-gel catalysts A solution containing Mg (OEt) 2 (0.05 mol ), 0.85 mol of ethanol and 0.02 mol of ammonium hydroxide was refluxed under constant stirring. After 10 min of reflux of LiCI aqueous solution was added by drops in the appropriate amounts to obtain 1 and 2 wt. % of Li. The products were dried at 70 70'C for 12 h and then treated at 200, 450 and 600 C. These solids were labeled Li/Mg0 SG. Impregnated catalysts Sol-Gel (labeled Li/MgO-I-SG) and, as a reference (Li/MgO-I-D), the commercial (Degussa) MgO untreated supports were impregnated with aqueous solutions of LiCl so as to have a final Li concentration of 1.0 and 2.0 wt.%. The products were dried at 70 C for 12 h and then treated at 200, 450 and 600 C. Characterization Solids were studied by IR spectroscopy using a Nicolet MX-1 unit. Pressure was applied to the catalyst powder (no KBr was used) until the pellet was transparent. Specific areas were measured using a Micromeritics Model 2300 apparatus. Catalytic activity The activity of the oxidative coupling of the methane, defined as methane conversion, was measured at atmospheric pressure in a flow quartz reactor at 750 C. The feed gas ratio composition CH4/OZ was 2 and the contact time was 3.35 g s/ml CH4 PTN. Before activity determinations all the catalysts were treated in air during 1 h at 750 C. Little notable deactivation was observed under these conditions during 2 h of reaction. Theoretical calculations In order to test the hypothesis of a large charge variation on the oxygen ions in the Li/MgO lattice we performed semi-empirical Extended Huckel (EH) and ab-initio self-consistent field (SCF) calculations on some model clusters. The working hypothesis is that when a lithium atom replaces a Mg ion in the MgO network, the oxygen ion (or ions) next to this metallic site suffer a charge loss, thus leading to O- ions rather than 02-; formally this situation has been represented by [Li+0- ] sites. T. Lopez et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 88 (1994) 71-84 75 Extended Mickel calculations The semi-empirical EH calculations were performed using the program [ 19 ] on the 41-atom cluster proposed by Mehandru et al. [ 14 ] which consists of three planes of 9, 16 and 16 atoms (see Fig. 1); the first plane has a magnesium atom in the center. For different Li concentrations (from 2.66 to 15.9 wt.%) all structures were optimized with the fcc constraint. SCF calculations In order to determine the charge distribution in the pure MgO lattice and in the Li-doped network with as much precision as possible, we performed SCF calculations on some linear MgO model clusters that have been successfully used before [ 15,16 ] with extended basis sets and on 25-atom clusters with minimal basis sets. The SCF calculations were performed using the PSHF program [ 20 ] which includes the relativistic effective core potential (RECP) method of Durand et al. [ 21 ] . This leaves us with a [ Ne ] core and 2 active electrons (3s2) for each Mg atom and with a [ He ] core and 6 valence electrons (2s22p4) for each oxygen atom. The RECP parameters for Mg and O can be found in ref. 22. Two different contractions of the same gaussian basis set were used in order to perform minimal and extended basis calculations. The minimal basis sets, which we shall call basis A from here onwards, are the ones reported in ref. 23 with contractions (5s5p) / [ 5,5 ] for oxygen and (4slp) / [ 4,1 ] for magnesium and lithium. The extended basis sets used are of quadruple-C type for oxygen (5s5p) / [2111,2111 ], and triple-C plus polarization (4slp)/ [211,1 ] for Mg and Li. The extended basis set calculations on the linear 7-atom cluster involve 72 molecular orbitals while the minimal basis calculations on the larger two layer 25-atom cluster involve 100 molecular orbitals. a Fig. 1. Schematic representation of the 41-atom model cluster used in the EH calculations. The 25-atom cluster used in the SCF calculations is obtained by deleting the lower layer. 76 T. Lopez et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 88 (1994) 71-84 Charge distribution is obtained in all cases using the Mulliken population analysis. Linear clusters Before performing any calculation on these rather simple clusters, we deemed it necessary to test if this model had a sound basis to study charge distributions in MgO crystals. It is well known [ 13 ] that the experimental charge of Mg is + 1.6 in pure MgO. We started by doing EH calculations on one-dimensional (with 11 atoms), two-dimensional (with 21 atoms) and threedimensional (with 31 atoms) linear clusters; this means that only the central oxygen atom connects the two or three perpendicular linear MgO chains. The charge on the central oxygen atom was -1.89, -1.83 and -1.78 for the 1-D, 2-D and 3-D clusters respectively. Since these figures are reasonably close to the experimental -1.6 value, for the SCF calculations we decided to use two linear Mg-O clusters (one containing 7 atoms and another containing 11 atoms) in order to study the central oxygen charge evolution with cluster size; both clusters had one oxygen atom in the center. For the one-dimensional 11-atom linear cluster, using the extended basis set which will later be described, the calculation already involves 116 atomic orbitals even using pseudopotentials. Here it should be mentioned that in order to account for the non-infiniteness of the Mg-O chains, a pseudo-atom (X) was used to terminate the linear chains at both ends. This pseudo-atom is described by the atomic valence orbitals of magnesium but has a single electron. This technique has been successfully used before in other studies [ 15,16 ] that used even smaller linear clusters than in this case. 25-Atom 2-layer model cluster In order to fill the gap between the rather simple model furnished by the linear Li/MgO clusters and the more realistic 3-dimensional model cluster (with 41 atoms) proposed by Mehandru et al. [ 14 ] , we performed SCF calculations on a sub-structure of this 3-layered (9,16,16 atoms) model cluster; we used the two upper planes containing 9 and 16 atoms respectively. This is equivalent to deleting the lower layer of the cluster in Fig. 1. The upper central atom was arbitrarily chosen to be oxygen. In order to study the effect of lithium/magnesium substitutions we placed the lithium atoms in different positions and made vertex, edge or central replacements. Results and discussion Experimental Figure 2 shows the IR spectra obtained for the Li/MgO sol-gel catalysts treated at different temperatures.

At 3439 cm-1 a wide band typical of the OH stretching mode can be seen. This band is due to water and ethanol molecules occluded in the gel and to superficial OH groups. At 3200 cm-1 a small shoulder can be observed which is due to vacancies in the Mg0 lattice produced by the presence of lithium atoms; this has already been pointed out by Kirklin et al. [ 24 ] . They report Vl vacancies which are related to the presence of hydroxyl groups in the magnesia, these vacancies give rise to a low intensity band in the IR region at 3296 cm-1. The vibration of the C-H bonds of the residual ethogy groups of the alkogide that did not react produced two bands at 2385 and 1417 cm-1. These are symmetric and antisymmetric bending modes. At 1630 cm-1 an 0H stretching band appears. This band tells us about the presence of occluded water molecules and ethanol molecules ( from the solvent and as a by-product ) after the gelation point. This band is rather intense since under these conditions the catalyst is highly hydrogylated. At 1064 cm-1 the Mg-O stretching 78 T. Lopex et al. / J Mol. Catal. 88 (1994) 71-84 frequency is found. In the low-energy (below 900 cm-1) region the magnesia bending and stretching bands can be seen in an undefined fashion. When the gel is treated at 200 C for 12 h the IR spectrum (Fig. 2b) is almost the same as it was for the treatment at 70 C. Nevertheless, the band at 1630 cm-1 and those due to the ethoxy groups are less intense. When the catalyst is treated at 450 C (Fig. 2) a partial dehydroxylation occurs -ig-O-ig- OH OH 2n Mg0 + Hz0 This leads to an intensity decrease in the high energy band and it is shifted towards 3427 cm-1. Here it is worth noticing that the shoulder due to vacancies as well as the band at 3700 cm-1 have disappeared since all the Mg (OH) Z has been transformed into MgO by the action of temperature. The band at 2385 cm-1 also disappears. The original band found in Fig. 2a at 1417 is shifted to 1450 cm-1 and has a much smaller intensity since at this temperature all the alkoxy groups have been carbonized or desorbed. At 600 C the catalyst is almost free of OH groups and has suffered substantial structural changes; this can be seen in Fig. 2d. In the low-energy region only a wide and rather weak band is obtained. When the MgO sol-gel support is impregnated in the conventional way, the IR spectra are very different (Fig. 3). In the fresh catalyst a very high energy band appears at 4042 cm-1 and the Mg (OH) 2 (which precipitates dur- w U Z N Z Q (c ) b00 C (b 1 200 C 3427 C _ H 1441 Et-OH H -OH Mg-OH Mg(OH12 ' Mg-O-H ~ (a 1 70 C 4800 3000 1800 1000 600 WAVENUMBERS (cm-I1 Fig. 3.

This means the water used during the impregnation phase is hydrating the magnesium oxide to form magnesium hydroxide. At 3427 cm-'the stretchingbands of MgOH, H-OH and Et-OH can be clearly seen. At 1630 cm-' a band due to molecular water can be seen; at 1441 cm-' a very large band appears due to the stretching Mg-OH and Mg-O-H modes. In the low-energy region the spectrum is undefined. When the solid is treated at 200 C the observed spectrum remains practically unchanged. With treatment at 600 C the high-energy bands (located at 4042 and 3697 cm-') disappear while those at 3435 and 1622 cm-' only decrease in intensity since in the post-gelation process a partial dehydro$ylation takes place. In Fig. 3c one can see that the 1441 cm-' band is shifted to 1499 cm-' since, due to the thermal treatment, the structural strength of the solid increases thus producing stronger Mg-O bonds. The low-energy region is, again, undefined. In Table 1 we present the specific areas for both types of sol-gel catalysts treated under different thermal conditions. It is clear that a strong decrease in specific areas occurs for both types of catalysts as the treatment temperature increases. This can be explained by the fact that in the fresh solids greater amounts of Mg (OH) 2 in brucite-type structure are present, thus increasing the measured areas. Activity and selectivities (defined as the mol of product/mol of total products) to CZ products are reported in Table 2. Sol-gel preparations result in less active catalysts than impregnated Li/MgO-I-D; however, in the oxidative coupling of methane a high selectivity to the formation of olefins is the goal of new catalysts design. In this way, sol-gel catalyst preparation results in highly selective solids to olefin formation. In Li/MgO catalysts with a Li content of 2 wt.% the ratio CZH4/C2H6 (olefin/paraffin) formation is 8 times higher for the sol-gel preparation than for the impregnated commercial MgO. This is in spite of the fact that the commercial support was impregnated in the same conditions as the sol-gel support, implying the same concentration of chloride ions. In any case chloride ion concentrations are very low. Therefore, the ef- TABLE 1 BET areas (M2/g) for Li/MgO sol-gel catalysts (with Li 2 wt.% concentration) treated at different temperatures Catalyst Preparation temp.

[ 25 ] for high chloride concentrations do not apply here. Li/MgO-I-SG catalysts at 2.0 Li wt.% show a higher olefin paraffin ratio than those observed for the same catalysts but at 1.0 Li wt.% (Table 2). In these samples it could be difficult to separate the effect of Me' substitution by Li' from chlorine effect, since both effects must depend on the amount of LiCl used for their preparation. The substitution of Me' by lithium in a highly hydroxylated sample (sol-gel sample) must also depend on the anion used during their preparation. Studies on this subject Eire in progress and will be the subject of a subsequent communication. To study the possible effect of the methane conversion degree in the selectivity, two samples were tested at the closest possible conversion. Li/Mg0SG and Li/MgO-I-Degussa samples at 1.0 Li wt.% show the same activity; however, the olefin paraffin ratio is 50% higher in the sol-gel preparation. Thus, the conversion degree is not the most important factor in selectivity. The high selectivity to olefin formation of sol-gel catalyst must originate from the preparation method as claimed in a previous communication [ 26 ] . The addition of LiCl during the gelation of magnesium ethoxide or the impregnation of the sol-gel support with the Li promoter seems to have an important effect in the nature of the active centers rather than in their number. The exchange of a Mg ion by a Li ion in the gel results in the formation of centers that produce the successive oxidative dehydrogenation and, hence, high selectivity to ethylene. Theoretical Extended HucOl calculations The pure MgO model cluster produced an average oxygen charge of -1.87 while that for magnesium is 1.88. Recalling that in the 41-atom model cluster we substituted Mg atoms by Li ones in concentrations varying from to 2.5 to 15 wt.%, the oxygen Mulliken charge population was found to decrease from -1.57 to -1.05 as lithium concentration increased as shown in Table 3. More doping can diminish the oxygen charge below -1.0. As Li doping increases, T. Lopez et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 88 (1994) 71-84 81 TABLE 3 Extended Mickel results for the 41-atom model cluster using different Li/MgO concentrations Li wt.% Average oxygen charge Number of substitutions Number of [Li+O- ] sites 2.5 -1.57 1 1 5 -1.30 2 2 10 -1.07 4 3 12.5-15 -1.05 5-6 4 TABLE 4 SCF Mulliken populations' for the linear 7-atom pure MgO cluster X 0 Mg 0 Mg 0 X Extended basis +0.37 -1.11 + 1.52 -1.56 + 1.52 -1.11 +0.37 X represents the saturating pseudo-atom. Extended basis set used, see text. the oxygen charge decrease is mainly observed in sites of low coordination (edges and corners). The number of [Li+0- ] centers also grows with lithium concentration. This concentration effect is in agreement with the experimental results of Driscoll et al. [5] on methane activation by Li/MgO catalysts. Self-consistent field calculations The pure Mg0 7-atom optimized linear cluster produced a central oxygen charge of -1.56 while for the 11-atom cluster this charge was -1.52. These charges are in good agreement with the experimental value of -1.6 of the real MgO lattice. Mulliken charges for the pure MgO cluster appear in Table 4. For this reason, subsequent calculations were made with the 7-atom cluster. With this in mind, we substituted one of the two nearest Mg atoms to the central oxygen by a lithium atom and proceeded to optimize this new Li/MgO model cluster. At this point it should be said that the only criterion we could use to optimize these clusters is that of energetic stability; this leads, of course, to interatomic distances slightly different (within 0.12 a.u.) from those found in the real three-dimensional lattice. The charge distribution found for this cluster can be seen in Table 5. These results indicate that when lithium replaces a magnesium atom the neighboring oxygen suffers great charge loss of more than one half electron which leads to an O- site. It is clear that the oxygen atom next to the substituted Li atom suffered a strong charge loss. This is in agreement with our EH calculations and with the proposed mechanism [5-7] and with the very accurate CASSCF+MRl calculations of B6rve and Peterson [ 18 ] by which an electron deficient oxygen ion abstracts one hydrogen atom from a C-H bond of methane. We can say that these SCF results are significant 82 T. Lopez et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 88 (1994) 71-84 TABLE 5 SCF Mulliken populations' for the linear 7-atom Li/MgO cluster X 0 Mg 0 Li 0 X Extended basis +0.13 -1.01 +1.65 -0.93 +0.89 -0.80 +0.07 eX represents the saturating pseudo-atom. For basis set definition see text. enough for the oxygen charge variation because this involves a change of more than 0.5 electron when magnesium was replaced by lithium. The SCF calculations on the 25-atom pure MgO model cluster using minimal basis sets produced an average oxygen charge of -1.35. When one magnesium atom was replaced by a lithium atom two oxygen sites showed a reduced charge of -0.99 while that for the substituted lithium is +0.75. When two substitutions were made again two oxygens presented a diminished charge of -0.87. The highest Li concentration (15 wt.%) was attained when three substitutions were made; this produced two oxygen (lithium) sites with a -0.96 ( +0.73) charge and two more with a -0.98 ( +0.55) charge. Conclusions In the FTIR spectra of the Li/MgO sol-gel catalysts a small shoulder can be seen at 3200 cm-1 (see Fig. 2), which evidently corresponds to the band attributed to Vl oxygen vacancies by Kirklin et al. [ 24 ] . This shoulder is absent in impregnated sol-gel catalyst Fig. 3. Even if no quantitative measure of the amount of oxygen vacancies in both sol-gel catalysts is given by IR results, the difference in both preparations techniques in this respect is quite evident. Even though sol-gel catalysts show a reduced activity for oxidative coupling of methane as compared with impregnated commercial MgO, they present a much higher (up to 8 times greater) selectivity to olefin formation. This fact casts some doubt on the very recently proposed hypothesis by Wu et al. [8] which states that near-surface oxygen vacancies with two electrons (F centers) are directly responsible for the hydrogen abstraction step in the oxidative coupling of methane over Li/MgO solids. If the oxygen vacancies were directly involved in hydrogen abstraction the measured activities for Li/Mg0-SG catalyst would be higher than those obtained for the impregnated Li/MgO-I-SG catalysts. The existence of [Li+O-) centers has been confirmed for MgO model clusters doped with 2.7 to 15.9 wt.% of lithium using Extended Huckel calculations and SCF calculations on reduced model clusters. In both types of calculations show a trend in the formation of [Li+0- ] sites as lithium concentration increases, a fact which is in agreement with the experimental results of methane oxidation. However our theoretical results cannot explain if the T. Lopez et al. / J. Mol. Catal. 88 (1994) 71-84 83 predicted [Li+0- ] sites are linked to the observed oxygen vacancies. In particular the EH calculations were specifically aimed to simulate sol-gel catalysts, since lithium atoms were considered in the bulk (not only on the surface) of the crystalline lattice.

Li/MgO catalysts were synthesized through the sol-gel method (using magnesium diethoxide and lithium chloride) and by traditional impregnation. FTIR results show that the sol-gel catalysts present higher hydroxylation as compared with impregnated ones. The features of the IR spectra are explained as the treatment temperature increases. In the preparation process of traditional impregnated catalysts much Mg (OH)2is formed which is later transformed into MgO by thermal treatment. BET areas are very similar for both types of catalysts. Theoretical semi-empirical Extended Hückel (EH) and self-consistent field (SCF) calculations were performed on Li/MgO model clusters to test the existence of [Li+O−] sites and oxygen vacancies. The EH calculations were done with Li concentrations varying from 2.66 to 15.9 wt.‰. Results show a trend towards the formation of [Li+O−] centers when Li concentration increases. This concentration effect is in agreement with the experimental results of methane activation. The SCF calculations using minimal and extended gaussian basis sets were performed on pure MgO and Li/MgO model clusters. These SCF results also show the creation of [Li+O−] sites which could explain the abstraction of hydrogen in the oxidative coupling of methane over Li/ MgO catalysts.
