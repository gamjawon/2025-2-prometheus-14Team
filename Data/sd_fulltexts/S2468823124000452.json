Over the years, there has been a continuous drive to precisely determine the structure and active sites of supported metal catalysts using atomistic-scale simulations. Computational simulations for catalysis inherently involve theoretical assumptions and may not entirely capture the complexity of experimental environments. With ongoing advances in both theory and computational resources, there is an endeavor to model “realistic” supported catalysts close to the experimental environment. This review article provides a brief overview of recent efforts in this direction. Density functional theory (DFT)-based global optimization is the most common method to model a supported catalyst, however, it has many limitations. It is not feasible with standard DFT to find multiple meta-stable structures of small nanoparticles (NPs) placed on a support and capture their dynamic nature. The DFT is also limited in its ability to simulate supported catalysts with nano-sized large particles due to high computational costs. Genetic algorithm (GA), grand-canonical Monte-Carlo (GCMC), kinetic Monte-Carlo (KMC), ensemble-average approach, and ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) have been used to overcome the limitations. We also discuss the encouraging prospects of machine learning (ML) capabilities. The ML models combined with computational chemistry assist in determining the structure of supported NPs with dynamic nature under realistic conditions. The ML potential has the capability to deal with supported NPs containing large number of atoms more accurately than force fields. We anticipate this review will provide direction for further investigation into computational methods for modeling supported catalysts.

Among the various types of catalysts, heterogeneous catalysts have been widely employed due to their inherent advantages, including ease of separation, high stability, and reusability [6]. Transition metal nanoparticles (NPs) anchored on inorganic oxide supports form a significant category within the domain of industrial heterogeneous catalysts. Their high surface area-to-volume ratio provides numerous active sites for catalytic reactions. Furthermore, the size, shape, and composition of NPs can be precisely controlled, resulting in a high degree of tunability in catalytic performance. However, there are broadly two challenges to overcome in utilizing supported metal NPs in catalytic applications in the chemical industry [7]. First, the diverse size distribution of NPs under realistic reaction conditions results in the lack of understanding of their structure-dependent catalytic activity and selectivity. Advancements in computational chemistry, particularly through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, have significantly expanded our understanding of structure-activity relationships of NPs but with the assumption that supports do not affect catalytic performance. Slab models with different crystal facets, edges, and corners under periodic boundary conditions have been extensively employed to establish structure-activity relationships [8]. A free-standing NP model in a vacuum has also been used to study the shape and size effects on heterogeneous catalysis [9,10]. Recently, there have been advancements in establishing structure-activity relationships of NP catalysts under realistic reaction conditions [11,12]. However, these results still do not include support effects on the shape and sizes of NPs. Second, understanding the fundamental role of metal-support interactions in heterogeneous catalysis is still limited. The primary role of solid support in heterogeneous catalysis is to offer a stable physical platform for metal NPs. However, since the 1970s, with the introduction of the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) [13], the indirect and direct roles of supports on catalytic performance have been extensively reported through experimental and theoretical studies [7]. Indirectly, supports can alter the shape of NPs [14] or induce electronic interactions between the support and NPs [15], thus impacting catalytic performance. Directly, interfaces at the metal-support boundary can offer active sites for catalytic reactions [16]. Despite the past studies, the intricate geometries of supported metal nanocatalysts and the complexity of realistic catalytic environments pose challenges in understanding the nature of particle-support interactions. To uncover a deeper understanding of the influence of supports on the shape and size of NPs, and catalytic performance under reaction conditions, theoretical investigations are shifting from idealized models (e.g., slab and NP in vacuum at 0 K) to more realistic models (e.g., NP placed on supports under experimental conditions). In this context, this article aims to review conventional approaches in modeling supported metal catalysts and discuss recent efforts towards adopting NP shapes and sizes under experimental operating conditions, such as temperature, pressure, adsorption of intermediates, and dynamic changes (Fig. 1 ). We will cover both the achievements and challenges in this area and outline potential strategies and directions for further advancing more realistic and efficient modeling of supported metal catalysts. 1.1 Modeling of supported subnanometric nanoparticles In general, smaller metal NPs have larger specific surface areas and expose a higher proportion of highly active, low-coordinated sites, such as edge and corner, resulting in increased catalytic activity. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) serve as a prime example, where only one atom is anchored onto the support. Although SACs have been demonstrated outstanding performance in various fields and have garnered significant attention [20], they exhibit limited structural variability compared to NPs with a higher number of atoms [54]. Therefore, in this review, we focus on modeling supported NPs, which involve more structural variations than SACs. Conventionally, DFT studies have been conducted to model static metal nanoclusters (or small nanoparticles) placed on supports using the global optimization method [21]. The prevalent approach was to optimize a metal cluster in the gas phase and subsequently reoptimize it on the support. For example, to model graphene-supported metal clusters, Zhou et al. optimized Au8 and Pt4 clusters in the gas phase and subsequently re-optimized them on a graphene monolayer [22]. However, it is well known that clusters would undergo significant shape changes in the presence of the support [23]. Therefore, an alternative approach was to identify the lowest-energy configuration among a set of possible configurations of nanocluster/support systems through global optimization calculations. Piotrowski et al. optimized a set of about 15 – 20 configurations for each TM4/CeO2(111) system (TM = Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Os, Ir, Pt, and Au) using DFT calculations to obtain the optimal TM4/CeO2(111) structures (Fig. 2a ) [17]. The Ru4, Rh4, Os4, and Ir4 clusters adopted a 2D zig-zag array configuration on the CeO2(111) surface, while the Cu4, Pd4, Ag4, Pt4, and Au4 clusters had a 3D tetrahedron as the lowest-energy configuration. It was pointed out that the obtained 2D and 3D nanoclusters on the surface and the lowest-energy nanoclusters in the gas phase can be structurally different. For instance, the lowest-energy structure of Rh4 in the gas phase is a tetrahedron, however, it forms 2D structures on the surface. This result shows that identifying the lowest-energy configurations of cluster/support systems would be a more reliable approach compared to optimizing an isolated cluster structure and subsequently re-optimizing it on the support. Genetic algorithms (GAs) have been a popular method for finding the global minimum structure of cluster/support systems [18]. GAs rely on a set of randomly generated initial candidates and operate through stochastic evolution. By conducting multiple independent GA runs, statistical averages yield a unique set of candidates. This is a powerful approach to diminish the need for human intervention in cluster/support optimization. For example, Vilhelmsen et al. found a structure for Au8/MgO(100) that was more stable than the previously known putative global minimum structures (Fig. 2b) [18]. Nevertheless, GAs do not provide a guarantee of finding the global minimum, particularly in the case of large systems with large search spaces, because they explore the search space in a probabilistic manner. Also, the computational cost for optimizing metal/support interactions at the DFT level of accuracy becomes often prohibitively high when dealing with supported catalysts with numerous possible configurations. The density functional-based tight-binding (DFTB) [24] method could be a viable option to reduce the computational cost. While both DFTB and DFT are based on the Kohn-Sham (KS) equation, DFTB employ a more approximated form of the KS equation, making it 2 to 3 orders of magnitude faster than DFT while maintaining a reasonable accuracy [25,26]. However, DFTB employs empirical parameters fitted to reproduce high-level quantum mechanical calculations or experimental data, and its accuracy is highly dependent on the quality of the parameterization. Furthermore, the parameters that are effective for a specific system might not yield satisfactory results in a different chemical environment. The approaches mentioned above mainly aim to produce the single or a few global minimum structures. However, small NPs exhibit pronounced dynamic behavior on the support owing to their inherent structural flexibility. These dynamic characteristics facilitate the creation of multiple metastable structures with different shapes under certain conditions, consequently leading to changes in their properties and functionalities. Due to the existence of various meta-stable structures in the supported nanocluster system, the global minimum structure would be inadequate to represent the experimentally measured catalytic performance under the reaction conditions [3,4]. One recent attempt to link the various meta-stable structures of supported nanoclusters with catalysis phenomena is the statistical ensemble representation approach. For instance, Ha et al. investigated the selective dehydrogenation reaction of alkanes to alkenes, taking into account various meta-stable isomers of the boron-doped Pt/Al2O3 system [3]. They found that the global minimum structures of Al2O3 supported Pt7 and Pt7B exhibit similar catalytic activities. However, when considering various meta-stable structures using an ensemble average approach, Pt7B showed higher coke resistance at elevated temperatures and coverages, consistent with experimental results (Fig. 2c). 1.2 Modeling of supported large nanoparticles Compared to the supported small NPs with various meta-stable structures, the supported large NPs would exhibit relatively well-defined structures and fewer meta-stable structures [30]. However, the large number of atoms in large NPs presents a bottleneck in supported NP modeling. An approach to mimic the actual size of the NP is to use the nanorod interface models based on the periodic boundary condition. A recent work by Hakimioun et al. systematically examined [31] the extent of metal-support interactions of Cu NPs and Cu nanowires supported on non-reducible MgO using DFT calculations. Their findings showed that the Cu nanowire model well reproduces the outcome of calculations with the NP model. As another example, Green et al. experimentally observed dual catalytic sites at the perimeter of 3 nm-sized Au NP supported on TiO2 during the CO oxidation reaction. Since it is unfeasible to model a 3 nm-sized Au NP consisting of 976 Au atoms using DFT due to the high computational cost, a 3-layer Au nanorod on the TiO2(110) surface was adopted to represent the interfacial region (Fig. 3a ). However, the oversimplified model was not sufficient to include the corner sites, experimentally known to be highly active for O2 activation. As a result, the DFT-calculated catalytic activity was relatively underestimated compared to the actual experimental activity. This implied that while a simplified nanorod/support model could be a computationally efficient approach, it might not fully capture the important active sites at the interface. It is feasible to model an actual-sized NP placed on support using the standard plane-wave DFT calculations but with some limitations in accuracy and NP shape. For instance, Lykhach et al. constructed hemisphere-shaped Pt x (x = 8, 34, 95)/CeO2(111) models to elucidate the size effect of NP for the charge transfer between metal and support (Fig. 3b) [29]. The DFT calculations showed that the Pt34 NP exhibited a greater charge transfer per Pt atom compared to the larger Pt95 NP (Fig. 3b) (see the δ value of Pt NPs). The result well captured the experimental trend that the charge transfer ability per Pt atom does not uniformly increase with the enlargement of NP size (Fig. 3b). In the DFT calculation, however, it was assumed that the morphology of Pt NPs is characterized by a hemispherical shape, as a means to reduce structural complexity, regardless of variations in their size. This assumption might not adequately represent the interfacial sites and interaction between the metal and support. In addition, the DFT calculations were conducted using a gamma-point-only k-point mesh, which does not guarantee high accuracy. Despite the sacrificed accuracy, significant amounts of computational resources over 106 CPU hours were consumed. This work underscores that, despite significant recent advances in computational capabilities, there remain constraints in simulating actual NP sizes through standard DFT calculations. 1.3 Supported metal catalysts in experimental reaction conditions The structural diversity emerging under reaction conditions should be incorporated into the modeling of supported catalysts. The DFT method is a technique performed at zero-temperature and zero-pressure. Coupling the DFT method with ab initio thermodynamics [34] is an established approach to determine the stable geometry and equilibrium composition of a supported catalyst when exposed to finite temperature and pressure conditions. However, implementing this approach for nanoclusters or NPs situated on support would not be straightforward, as the manual generation of an adequate number of potential configurations becomes extremely challenging. The grand-canonical Monte-Carlo (GCMC) method combined with the GA offers an alternative method for systematically determining stable structures through stochastic configurational sampling. As an example, Liu et al. investigated the CO oxidation on Pd/CeO2 using the combined GCMC and GA method [35]. Based on GA, they first explored over 500 candidates to attain a globally optimal structure of a Pd8 particle on CeO2(111). A GCMC approach was then employed to consider alterations in the composition of Pd8/CeO2 resulting from exposure to gaseous oxygen. While useful, the approach requires substantial computational resources for a large system, as it relies on the DFT method for energy calculations. Combining the GCMC method with ReaxFF (reactive force field) based molecular dynamics (MD) [36] allows for the treatment of larger active metal/support systems compared to the GCMC-DFT method. However, the GCMC-ReaxFF method has some limitations, including reduced accuracy, limited applicability across the periodic table of elements, and a lack of electron transfer between the active catalysts and support. Moreover, GCMC-based methods cannot fully capture the dynamic characteristics of nanoclusters or NPs on a support over time. This limitation can hinder the complete modeling of an active metal/support structure, as the stability of the global minimum structure determined under finite temperature and pressure conditions may not be guaranteed during the catalytic reaction. To capture the dynamic nature of supported catalysts over time at a given temperature, pressure, and in the presence of adsorbates, DFT-based ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation has been extensively employed. Wang et al. delved into the reactivity and dynamic behavior of Au50/CeO2 (111) during the CO oxidation reaction at elevated temperatures (300 and 700 K) in the presence of CO [32]. It was found that Au atoms at the interface spontaneously migrated to the perimeter region along with an adsorbed CO molecule under the actual reaction condition (Fig. 4a ). Furthermore, the dynamically formed Au single-atom site enhanced the CO oxidation activity. This result highlighted the active sites in active metal/support catalysts may be created only under actual reaction conditions. As shown in this study, DFT-based AIMD is a powerful tool; however, it imposes significant computational demands due to its quantum mechanical treatment of electrons. One path to overcome the severe time scale limitation of AIMD simulations is to use enhanced sampling techniques. Within the domain of heterogenous catalysis, biasing potential-based methods, such as metadynamics [37] and umbrella sampling [38], are commonly favored. The enhanced sampling techniques allow the integration of both the mobility of surface atoms and their associated entropy into the modeling of catalysis in supported metal catalysts. These techniques also enable the estimation of a multidimensional free energy surface (FES), which represents the true landscape to be explored. For example, AIMD and metadynamics simulations by Payard et al. showed that the dynamic features of PtGa NPs supported on silica improve the activity, selectivity, and stability of this catalyst for propane dehydrogenation [39]. 1.4 Applications of machine learning to aid in modeling of supported metal catalysts Geometry optimization is often the most time-consuming aspect of calculating thermodynamic (e.g. adsorption energy and reaction energy) and kinetic (e.g. transition state energy) properties using DFT, as it consists of a sequence of iterative calculation of forces. An area of growing significance is the use of machine learning (ML) to predict energetics, such as adsorption energy, and then integrate them into existing structure-search methods, such as GCMC and kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC). For example, in a recent paper, a computational framework combining ML with GCMC and GA was developed to determine structures of Pd n (n = 1 – 55) on CeO2 (111) at elevated temperatures in a CO atmosphere [30]. ML models were utilized to predict the total energy and CO adsorption energy of Pd/CeO2(111) for GA and GCMC, respectively (Fig. 4b). The developed framework showed that CO facilitates the restructuring and stabilization of intermediate-size clusters. The same research group also showed that ML-based energetics of clusters and adsorption energies trained from DFT data can be incorporated into KMC simulations [40]. This computational approach was applied to study the structure evolution of Pd/CeO2(111) at various catalyst loadings, temperatures, and exposures to CO at experimentally relevant time scales. These advanced computational frameworks, combined with ML, hold the potential to open up vast opportunities for determining the stable structures and dynamic behavior of supported catalysts. ML has also found utility in developing atomistic potentials, called machine learning potentials (MLPs). MLP utilizes machine learning models trained on quantum mechanical calculations, such as DFT, to construct interatomic interactions. MLP provides an accelerated means to evaluate the potential energy surface (PES) for a given molecular configuration without the requirement of solving quantum mechanical equations. This capability enables the simulation of large systems that are typically not feasible with the DFT method. Liu et al. investigated the sintering of Au NPs on CeO2(111) [33] with a large time and length scale using deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD) [41]. DPMD simulations were conducted for an Au128 NP and two Au32 NPs placed on CeO2- x (111) with step-edges at 700 K for 10 ns (Fig. 4c). Au32 on flat CeO2- x (111) was movable and readily merged into Au128, while Au32 at the step site was highly stable, in good agreement with the time-resolved high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) result (Fig. 4d). This result shows the value of MLPs for realistic modeling of active metal/support catalysts under reaction conditions. 2 Future perspectives As discussed in the previous section, DFT-based energetics and structural information have been extensively employed in the development of ML models, integrated with structure-search frameworks, to predict the stable structures of supported catalysts with relatively low computational cost and high accuracy. There have been attempts to develop ML-based structure determination models using both computational chemistry and experimental data as input. Such ML models, including training data measured experimentally, would be a powerful tool to determine the structures of catalytic materials under realistic conditions. For example, Timoshenko et al. developed a neural network model that takes the experimental and simulated extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data as input for well-defined mono- and bimetallic NPs and provides partial radial distribution functions (PRDFs) as output [42,43]. The intensity of PRDFs features were used to construct 3D structure models of mono and bimetallic NPs with various sizes and compositions under experimental conditions. This strategy is attractive for extracting information about the material structure in real-time under realistic conditions. However, it is currently limited to metallic NP systems. This approach would become more powerful if it could be generalized and applicable to determine supported catalysts. Moreover, MLPs derived from PES constructed from QM calculations can provide an alternative approach for atomistic simulations that are feasible for large systems over long time scales. Several promising outcomes have been reported for designing heterogeneous catalysts [44–47]. However, challenges toward the accurate structure prediction for significantly larger and more intricate systems, including supported metal catalysts, continue to be present. One of the current hindrances of the utilization MLPs for modeling supported catalysts is the limited scalability and transferability of ML methods. For example, Liu et al. trained ML potential from DFT data and performed DPMD simulations to investigate the fluorine spillover in palladium NPs supported on ceria (Pd536/Ce320O640) and silica (Pd253/Si300O600) [48]. The DPMD simulation enabled the provision of a truly dynamic picture of reactant migration and demonstrated the significance of defects on ceria and the Pd-ceria interfaces in the initial adsorption of fluorine. However, the trained MLP is system-specific, and a new MLP should be trained for a system with different pairs of elements. To address this challenge, the creation of high-quality training datasets becomes crucial. Given that the required amount of training data increases alongside the size and complexity of systems, the task of developing an MLP for supported metal catalysts is more challenging. Publicly available datasets, such as the Materials Project [49], the Catalysis-Hub [50], the Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20) dataset [51], and the Open Catalyst 2022 (OC22) [52], can be valuable for accelerating the development of a generalized MLP. Developing an MLP for a wide range of elements not only requires vast datasets but also high-dimensional parameters. These parameters can deviate from physical interpretability, making them less comprehensible and inadvertently increasing computational costs. In the quest to overcome these challenges, efforts are being made towards developing universal MLPs. For instance, Lei et al. utilized features grounded in physical relevance for MLP training [53]. This approach not only reduced the number of parameters but also enhanced computational efficiency, retaining a model that is more interpretable for humans. Impressively, their universal force field framework demonstrated relatively high accuracy, even for elements that were not part of the original training set. Additionally, these methodologies should be anchored in physically meaningful parameters, ensuring both universality and computational affordability. As the computer simulation-based design of catalysts has been very successful over the last two decades [55], we believe that the revolutionary progress in MLPs eventually leads to a deeper understanding of supported metal catalysts by bridging the gap between atomistic model systems and real catalytic systems.

        "dc:description": "Over the years, there has been a continuous drive to precisely determine the structure and active sites of supported metal catalysts using atomistic-scale simulations. Computational simulations for catalysis inherently involve theoretical assumptions and may not entirely capture the complexity of experimental environments. With ongoing advances in both theory and computational resources, there is an endeavor to model “realistic” supported catalysts close to the experimental environment. This review article provides a brief overview of recent efforts in this direction. Density functional theory (DFT)-based global optimization is the most common method to model a supported catalyst, however, it has many limitations. It is not feasible with standard DFT to find multiple meta-stable structures of small nanoparticles (NPs) placed on a support and capture their dynamic nature. The DFT is also limited in its ability to simulate supported catalysts with nano-sized large particles due to high computational costs. Genetic algorithm (GA), grand-canonical Monte-Carlo (GCMC), kinetic Monte-Carlo (KMC), ensemble-average approach, and ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) have been used to overcome the limitations. We also discuss the encouraging prospects of machine learning (ML) capabilities. The ML models combined with computational chemistry assist in determining the structure of supported NPs with dynamic nature under realistic conditions. The ML potential has the capability to deal with supported NPs containing large number of atoms more accurately than force fields. We anticipate this review will provide direction for further investigation into computational methods for modeling supported catalysts.",
