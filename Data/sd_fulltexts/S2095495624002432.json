Graphical abstract Compared to the initial state, the “zero” state of the second-order differential capacity of the discharge curve can be used to identify the crystal structure disorder state of the electrode materials. Single-crystal Ni-rich cathodes are a promising candidate for high-energy lithium-ion batteries due to their higher structural and cycling stability than polycrystalline materials. However, the phase evolution and capacity degradation of these single-crystal cathodes during continuous lithation/delithation cycling remains unclear. Understanding the mapping relationship between the macroscopic electrochemical properties and the material physicochemical properties is crucial. Here, we investigate the correlation between the physical-chemical characteristics, phase transition, and capacity decay using capacity differential curve feature identification and in-situ X-ray spectroscopic imaging. We systematically clarify the dominant mechanism of phase evolution in aging cycling. Appropriately high cut-off voltages can mitigate the slow kinetic and electrochemical properties of single-crystal cathodes. We also find that second-order differential capacity discharge characteristic curves can be used to identify the crystal structure disorder of Ni-rich cathodes. These findings constitute a step forward in elucidating the correlation between the electrochemical extrinsic properties and the physicochemical intrinsic properties and provide new perspectives for failure analysis of layered electrode materials. Keywords Single-crystal cathodes Capacity decay Phase transition Differential capacity analysis 1 Introduction Electric vehicles (EVs) charged with electricity from clean energy have become one of the robust initiatives to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change [1], driving the rapid growth of the EVs market. Considering the limited endurance mileage of traditional battery systems, Ni-rich layered cathodes with high-energy density are considered as the most promising materials for next-generation EVs. However, these Ni-rich cathodes with high-Ni contents and polycrystal morphologies suffer from irreversible phase changes [2,3], crystalline interface cracking [4], and interface side reaction [5,6], etc., particularly at high cut-off voltage operating conditions, which further result in rapid capacity decay during cycling. Single-crystallization of Ni-rich cathode has become one of the effective strategies to resolve interface cracking and enhance cycling stability [7]. Compared to polycrystalline particles with varying orientations and grain boundary contacts, the single-crystal Ni-rich materials without grain boundaries between primary particles have excellent mechanical strength [8–11], which further facilitates improved thermal and interfacial stability [12]. However, the longer Li-ion transport paths limit the kinetics of single-crystal materials due to the larger particle size. In addition, the sluggish kinetics may lead to inconsistent Li-ion concentration and structural stresses within the single-crystal particles during charge/discharge cycling. This leads to increased intracrystalline defects in the single-crystal particles, further inhibiting their electrochemical kinetic properties and leading to rapid capacity decay [13]. Actually, the single-crystal strategy is still difficult to completely overcome the problems of cationic mixing, anisotropy, and lattice oxygen release caused by the evolution of the intrinsic structure of cathodes [14,15]. Although modification technologies can improve the physicochemical properties of single-crystal electrodes, the lack of in-depth study of intrinsic structural evolution limits the potential for further improvement in practical applications. The crystal structure of the Ni-rich cathodes undergoes continuous phase transition periodically with lithium-ion insertion/deinsertion. Two-phase conversion is prone to mechanical degradation due to the coherency strain energy and interfacial energy, especially when the lattice parameters between the two phases are too different [16,17]. In general, the H2-H3 irreversible phase transition is considered one of the leading causes of capacity decay [18]. However, few studies have been conducted to qualitatively or quantitatively analyze the evolution of electrochemical properties and phase transition during aging cycling, especially micron-scale single-crystal Ni-rich cathodes. Therefore, it is necessary to systematically explore the performance decay and physicochemical properties evolution behavior of Ni-rich single-crystal cathode with suitable size during the cycling process, which can be used as a reference for reasonable improvement and optimization of next-generation advanced materials. Here, we demonstrate the mapping relationship between material phase characteristics and electrochemical capacity decay of single-crystal LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (SC-NCM811) by using the differential capacity (dQ dV −1) method. Benefiting from the long-range ordered crystal structure of the single-crystal, the capacity decay of cathode materials is mainly dominated by interfacial side reactions under conventional upper cut-off voltages (UCVs). Above the high UCVs, the dominant mechanism of capacity degradation of single-crystal cathodes is the irreversible bulk phase transition. Additionally, we also find that second-order differential capacity (d2 Q dV −2) discharge characteristic curves can be used for non-destructive identification of crystal structure disorder in single-crystal Ni-rich cathode. Our experimental results elucidate the relationship between capacity decay, phase transition, and interfacial side reactions, while providing new guidelines for optimized modification and non-destructive failure analysis of single-crystal cathodes. 2 Experimental 2.1 Electrode and battery preparation The electrode slurry was prepared by mixing 80 wt% SC-NCM811 cathode with ∼3.5 μm grain size (Shenzhen Huaqing New Material Technology Co., Ltd.), 10 wt% carbon acetylene black, and 10 wt% polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), and then ball milled for 30 min. After obtaining the homogenous slurry, it was uniformly coated onto Al foil current collectors, followed by vacuum drying at 80 °C for 12 h. The electrode sheets were punched into 11 mm diameter circular disks before being transferred into the glovebox. The active mass loading of cathodes was between 2.3 and 2.8 mg cm−2. The 2025-type coin cells were assembled in an Argon-filled glove box with O2 and H2O contents of less than 0.01 ppm by use as-prepared SC-NCM811 electrode, a Li foil, a Celgard 2500 separator, and 60 μL commercial electrolyte (1 M LiPF6 in 1:1:1 v/v EC:DMC:DEC, Guangdong Canrd New Energy Technology Co., Ltd.). 2.2 Electrochemical measurements The electrochemical performances were examined by a NEWARE battery tester at different UCVs of 4.1, 4.3, 4.5, 4.7, and 4.9 V (vs. Li/Li+) at 30 °C in temperature-controlled incubators. The cells were all subjected to the initial three formation cycles of C/10 (1 C = 180 mA g−1) before the long-term cycle measurements. The low current electrochemical cycling tests at C/20 were performed every 24 cycles at the different voltage range cycling tests. Before and after long-term cycle tests, the GITT and Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were measured to evaluate the kinetic characteristics of the battery. The GITT was performed within a voltage range of 2.6–4.3 V for a 600 s galvanostatic pulse at a C/10 rate, followed by 1,800 s relaxation. The D L i + is calculated using simplified Eq. (1) [19]. (1) D L i + = 4 π τ R s 3 2 ( Δ E s Δ E t ) 2 where τ is the pulse time (600 s), R s is the solid phase equivalent radius (1.75 μm), ΔE s is the steady-state voltage change, and ΔE t represents the voltage change during the galvanostatic pulse. The EIS was tested in the frequency range of 100 KHz to 100 MHz by an electrochemical workstation (CorrTest Instruments, China). After electrochemical cycles, the electrodes were removed from the coin cells. The cycled electrodes were rinsed with dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and dried in an Argon-filled glove box for further study. 2.3 Materials characterization The phase evolution during battery charge/discharge cycling were determined by in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD, BRUCKER D8 ADVANCE, USA) with a Cu K α X-ray source (λ = 1.541 Å, 40 kV, 40 mA). All the data were collected with a scan angle (2θ) of 15–80° (1.5° min−1). The lattice parameters of electrode were further analyzed via Rietveld refinement using General Structure Analysis System (GSAS) software [20]. To investigate the gas evolution with battery charge/discharge process, the differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS, Hiden HPR40, UK) was performed in different operating voltages at 0.5 C. The surface morphology of the samples was performed with a cold field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi Regulus 8230, Japan). The surface functional groups and elemental composition were examined by ex-situ Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR, Nicolet 6700, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific K-Alpha, USA). All of the tests were conducted at room temperature except otherwise noted. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Electrochemical evaluation The batteries used in this study are Li/SC-NCM811 half-cell within different UCVs from 4.1 to 4.9 V (named as low [4.1 V], conventional [4.3 V], high [4.5 and 4.7 V], and ultrahigh UCVs [4.9 V], respectively). The charge/discharge steps included of 0.5 C cycle and C/20 constant current (CC) information collection. During the aging cycles, the low-rate charge/discharge curve is used to determine the phase evolution and the corresponding capacity contribution. Excess electrolytes and lithium are used to avoid side reactions and signal interference caused by crosstalk between the graphite anode and SC-NCM811 electrodes [21]. More experimental details are provided in the experimental section. The performance decay of SC-NCM811 electrodes within different UCVs is displayed in Fig. 1 (a) and Fig. S1. As the UCVs increase, the initial discharge capacity rises gradually until the capacity release is limited when it rises to 4.7 V. The decrease in discharge capacity under ultrahigh UCVs may be related to irreversible phase transition and interfacial side reactions. After 200 aging cycles, the low UCVs exhibit the lowest capacity loss (25.12%). The electrochemical properties are gradually stabilized at 4.5 and 4.7 V, indicating that the single-crystal structure can effectively improve the cycling stability of the material at high UCVs. Compared to the conventional UCVs, the capacity loss gradually decreases at high UCVs, which may be related to the enhancement of SC-NCM811 electrodes stability by the pinning effect of the antisite defect and inactive rock-salt phase at high state of charge (SoC) [22,23]. SC-NCM811 electrodes exhibit more pronounced capacity degradation at ultrahigh UCVs, which is associated with severe irreversible phase transitions and interfacial side reactions at their ultrahigh SoC [24]. As shown in Fig. 1(b), the electrochemical properties of SC-NCM811 electrodes under different UCVs show the same gradual rule as the aging cycle. As the UCVs increase, the rate performance improves under both conventional and high voltage cycle conditions compared to low voltage. However, with the UCVs continues to increase, the rate performance at ultrahigh UCVs start to deteriorate due to its bulk phase transition and intensified interfacial side reactions. This further indicates that single-crystal materials have a limited range of UCVs, which is also confirmed in the long-cycle experiments of the battery, as shown in Fig. 1(c). The CV and dQ dV −1 curves are used to investigate the phase evolution during Li+ insertion/extraction in the first three cycles for battery activation with different UCVs. Under different UCVs, SC-NCM811 electrodes experience various phase changes and capacity decay paths (shown in Fig. 1d–g). Within the voltage window of 2.6–4.9 V, three pairs of redox peaks exist from low to ultrahigh UCVs, corresponding to the three main phase transition processes, original layered structure (H1) to monoclinic phase (M), monoclinic to hexagonal phase (M + H2), and hexagonal to hexagonal phases (H2 + H3a), respectively. In addition, the H3a to H3b (highly delithiated) phase transition process occurs during the activation process of ultrahigh UCVs [15,25,26]. Of note, the CV oxidation peak and the corresponding H3a + H3b characteristic peaks of the dQ dV −1 charging curves disappear at the end of activation and are only observable in the corresponding reduction peaks and discharge differential capacity curves, which may be related to the structural stability of SC-NCM811 electrodes [15]. In addition, H3a has the same O3 oxygen stacking as H3b, but with significantly different crystal structure parameters [25]. Compared with the low UCVs charge/discharge cycling without the H2 + H3a phase transition, the other UCVs undergo the H2 + H3a phase transition process with different intensities, which can be seen by the relative heights of the dQ dV −1 charge curve. To deeply analyze different UCVs capacity decay mechanisms, the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) measurement is used to analyze the Li-ion transport kinetics before and after aging cycle (shown in Fig. S2 and Table S1). The conventional UCVs were used as a GITT test parameter for ease of comparison. After the activation of SC-NCM811 electrodes, the periodic changes of D L i + in the different phase transition intervals are correlated with the corresponding changes of their crystal structures during charge/discharge. The Li+ diffusion efficiency gradually increases after activation compared to the conventional UCVs. Until the ultra-high UCVs, its diffusion rate relatively decreases. The higher Li+ diffusivity at low UCVs correlates with the restricted diffusion kinetics of the single-crystal materials. Compared to conventional UCVs, the Li+ diffusivity of activated high-UCVs is enhanced, indicating that appropriately high UCVs is advantageous for improving kinetics. The lower Li+ diffusivity at ultrahigh UCVs may be related to the interfacial side reactions. After aging cycling, the decrease in Li+ diffusivity at low UCVs is attributed to the presence of an interfacial side-reaction layer, while the decrease in Li+ diffusivity at other UCVs is associated with the formation of bulk-phase defects (rock-salt phases) resulting from irreversible phase transition of H2-H3 (H2 + H3a + H3b). This is also illustrated by the further limitation of D L i + especially at high charge states. To better understand the coupling of capacity decays and phase transitions, the differential capacity analysis of the charge/discharge curves was performed to determine further the phase transition capacity contribution of the aging cycling process at different UCVs. 3.2 Intrinsic phase behavior Under real-world conditions, cell aging data are usually discrete, noisy, and collected non-periodically, and differential analysis based on this data will further amplify the noise and make the results more uncontrollable [27]. Therefore, the degradation characteristics of SC-NCM811 electrodes under different UCVs are analyzed by periodic and low charge/discharge rate (C/20). As shown in Fig. 2 (a–c) and Figs. S3-S7, due to the charging process phase transition characteristic peak position being relatively fixed will not appear discharge dQ dV −1 curve voltage decay and phase shift, the dQ dV −1 used to determine the phase evolution during the charging process of SC-NCM811 electrodes. The “zero” ( d 2 Q d V 2 = 0 ) value is used to determine the onset and cut-off voltage of phase transition by differentiating the first order differential capacity curve again. By analyzing the characteristic peaks of the battery cyclic charge/discharge curves, it is possible to assess the evolution of the physical phase and capacity contributions [28]. As shown in Fig. 2(d), the dQ dV −1 contour plot clearly showed almost no attenuation of each phase transition capacity contribution under low UCVs. With the increase of UCVs, the intensity of M + H2 and H2 + H3a phases decreases gradually. Notably, the presence of phase H3a + H3b was not detected during the subsequent charging cycle at the ultrahigh UCVs, and the other phase transition characteristic peak signals gradually disappeared. The experimental results show that the degrees of irreversibility of different phase transitions are, in order, H3a + H3b, H2 + H3a, M + H2, and H1 + M. The H1 + M phase transition shift may be related to the presence of defects in the layered structure of the SC-NCM811, which makes the material less electrochemically active. Among them, the H2-H3 phase transition can be used as material capacity decay and cycle stability is due to the phase irreversibility and the peak position relatively fixed without shift. To get more insight into the dominant mechanisms of capacity decay, the phase transition contribution percentage and cumulative discharge capacity are shown in Fig. 2(e) and Tables S2–S6, for comparative analysis (percentage stacked and corresponding scatter plots). During the aging cycle, the H1-M phase capacity contribution tends to increase gradually with the increase of the UCVs and the cycle number due to the irreversible phase capacity decay. The gradual decrease in the H2-H3 capacity contribution at the conventional UCVs indicates that the irreversible phase transition of H2-H3 is one of the main reasons for the capacity decay of the SC-NCM811 electrodes, which is consistent with the literature reports and also verifies the analysis above. In addition, the “zero” point used to mark the phase transition interval shifts as the cell aging cycle process. The mathematical significance of the “zero” shift indicates that the demarcation line of different phase transitions tends to blur, which suggests that there is a tendency for the H2-H3 and M-H2 phase transitions to merge (Figs. S3-S7). The appearance of mixed phases may be related to disorder defects within the single-crystal crystal structure. Li/Ni inversion defects, slip defects of the transition metal layer, and irreversible bulk phase defects make the kinetically limited single-crystal particles exhibit phase mixing and a rapid capacity decrease. 3.3 Structural and gas evolution To better understand the structure evolution and capacity decay of SC-NCM811 electrodes, in-situ XRD was performed during charge/discharge cycling processes with different UCVs from 4.1 to 4.9 V, as shown in Fig. 3 (a–c) and Figs. S8–S12. The SC-NCM811 electrodes (003) peak gradually decreases during charging at low UCVs, while the (101) diffraction peak continuously increases (shown in Fig S8). Typically, the (003) and (101) peaks trace the shift in the c- and a-axis lattice parameters, respectively [29]. Compared to the low UCVs, the (003) characteristic peak of the conventional UCVs varies differently, gradually decreasing and then finally increasing. As the UCVs increases, the further delithium of the material forms the H3b phase, while the diffraction angle of the (101) peak continues to increase until it remains unchanged at high UCVs (0.77°). The (003) and (101) diffraction peaks show significant phase separation and broadening during this process, which is due to the difference in the lattice parameters of the hexagonal and monoclinic phases when the two phases coexist [30]. The (018) diffraction peak exhibits a similar phase transition behavior to the (003) peak, while the (110) and (113) diffraction peaks are similar to the limited peak shift of the (101) diffraction peak. Among them, the evolution of the (003) and (101) diffraction peaks are positively correlated with the evolution of the c and a lattice parameter of the SC-NCM811 electrodes [8]. As shown in Fig. 3(d) and Fig. S13, at low UCVs, the crystal structure undergoes a contraction of the a-axis and an expansion of the c-axis, distinguishing it from the c-axis expansion followed by contraction under other UCVs. In particular, the generation of delithiated rock-salt phases during the ultrahigh UCVs charging process causes the c-axis to contract dramatically. During the discharging process, the trends of the a- and c-axis lattice parameters are almost identical to the charging. Notably, the phase separation of the discharge process still exists, but the diffraction peak broadening phenomenon is improved, which is attributed to the excellent mechanical strength and structural stability of the single-crystal material. Corresponding to the phase transition processes, the increase in the layer spacing during the H1 + M and M + H2 phase transitions is accompanied by a contraction of the a-axis, and the layer spacing during the H2 + H3a phase transition is rapidly reduced. This sharp change in lattice parameters indicates the presence of lattice strain [31]. The difference in the structural evolution of different UCVs indicates that H2-H3 phase is one of the dominant factors leading to capacity decline, which is also a common view at present [32]. In order to identify the physicochemical evolution of the interface, operando differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) was used to detect the gas generation. Continuous DEMS measurements are used to compare gas evolution laws under different UCVs in parallel. As shown in Fig. 3(e), no obvious gas evolution signals were found at low and conventional UCVs, and the surface single-crystal morphology was designed to facilitate the suppression of interfacial side reactions [33]. Towards the end of the high UCVs (4.7 V) discharge process, a clear signal of gas evolution begins to appear, which may be related to the electrolyte decomposition induced by Ni catalysis at the interface of the irreversible phase transition process. During the charge/discharge cycle under ultrahigh UCVs, H2 and CO2 gas production increase, accompanied by the decrease of O2 and C2H4 signals. In this case, the oxygen is mainly derived from the lattice oxygen escape due to the irreversible phase transition of the highly delithiated layered oxide cathodes. The production of reactive oxygen species promotes CO2 generation, while its side reaction products (H2O) further accelerate the by-product H2 generation [34], as shown in Fig. 3(f). The experimental results showed that the SC-NCM811 electrodes below the ultrahigh UCVs have excellent cycling stability, and the capacity decay mechanism is mainly dominated by the phase transition. During the ultrahigh UCVs cycling process, the rapid capacity decay mainly originates from the escape of high state of charge lattice oxygen and the serious chain side reactions at the interface. 3.4 Postcycling characterization In order to determine the correlation between the electrochemical properties and the physical-chemical characteristics of SC-NCM811 electrodes before and after cycling, the bulk-interface characteristics evolution was further investigated. As shown in Fig. S14, the single-crystal material still maintains a relatively intact particle after the aging cycle, which is significantly different from that of the polycrystalline material in terms of particle pulverization and microcrack extension. As the UCVs increase, an irregular layer of side reaction products gradually forms on the surface of the particles. In addition to the interfacial products, the crystal structure of the single-crystal body after the aging cycle also changed significantly (shown in Fig. 4 a). The peak shape of the (003) lattice plane was broadening, accompanied by the gradual disappearance of the characteristic splitting peak of the (102)/(006), and the appearance of a rock-salt phase product. After the low UCVs cycling without H2-H3 phase transition, the crystallinity of the crystal structure decreases, and no new phase appears. The decrease in crystallinity of the crystal structure of SC-NCM811 cathodes is associated with structural fatigue due to periodic lattice cell volume changes during battery charging/discharging. Compared with conventional UCV cycling products, it is further shown that H2-H3 phase induces the formation of an irreversible phase in SC-NCM811 cathodes materials. After high and ultrahigh UCVs cycling, the generation of irreversible transition metal rock-salt phases petrography limits the effective release of electrochemical properties of the SC-NCM811 electrodes. These results are consistent with the above differential capacity analysis. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) is also performed to characterize the evolution of interface characteristics. As shown in Fig. 4(b), XPS spectra were pointed out to reveal the interfacial evolution of pristine and cycled SC-NCM811 cathodes after 200 cycles at different UCVs. Before the aging cycling, the Ni 2p spectrum shows three peaks with binding energies of 854.3, 855.8, and 858.4 eV, assigned to Ni2+, Ni2+, and Ni3+, respectively [35,36]. In the F 1s spectrum, the C–F peak at 688.1 eV is attributed to the PVDF binder. The binding energies of 529.6, 531.9, and 533.2 eV in the O 1s spectrum of pristine SC-NCM811 electrodes was attributed to TM–O, C = O, and C–O, respectively [37]. After the aging cycling, the cathode-electrolyte interphase that formed on SC-NCM811 electrodes contained LiF (peaks at 685.0 eV in the F 1s), Li x PO y F z (peaks at 687.2 eV in the F 1s spectrum and 136.8 eV in the P 2p spectrum), O–C = O (peaks at 289.8 eV in the C 1s), and P–O (peaks at 133.5 eV in the P 2p), which is derived from interfacial side reactions [38,39]. Among them, LiF generation is associated with H2 evolution [40], and the appearance of Li x PO y F z is associated with LiPF6 degradation. In Fig. S15, the continuously decrease of the Ni 2p signal may be related to the thickening of the interfacial side reactions layer, which makes its signal difficult to be detected. To analyze the differences with different UCVs, the area between the fitted curves of XPS and the background was used to determine the detailed evolution of the interfacial element occurrence state before and after the aging cycles, as shown in Fig. S16. As the UCVs increase from 4.1 to 4.5 V, the Ni2+/Ni3+ ratio gradually decreases, which may be related to the preferential deposition of interface by-products in the area where surface anti-site defects occur. The reactivity of electrodes surface was positively correlated with the UCVs at the initial stage of charge and discharge of the cells. This causes the defect-generating regions to deposit by-products first at higher UCVs, thus affecting the effective detection of signals from the Ni2+ regions covered by interfacial by-products (shown in Fig. S17). In 4.7 and 4.9 V UCVs cycled electrodes, the rise of Ni2+ may be associated with the dissolution of transition metals [41]. The LiF signal of H2 byproduct indicates that the side reaction at the interface is also one of the reasons for the capacity decay of SC-NCM811 cathodes. The anomalous decrease of LiF at ultrahigh UCVs is related to the different deposition sequences of its cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI) components. The interfacial side reaction (H2 generation) by-products are deposited first at the beginning of the ultrahigh UCVs cycling, followed by EC electrolyte reduction products (solid carbonate deposition) depositing on any exposed surface area of the SC-NCM811 cathodes [40]. As the battery cycles, the ultrahigh UCVs interface is constantly covered by new by-products, which leads to the evolution of interface components different from the conventional and high UCVs, especially the abnormality of LiF and P-O components. In addition, the fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra was carried out to investigate the interfacial composition of the cycled SC-NCM811 cathodes at different UCVs, shown in Fig. S18. Compared to the pristine electrode material, the characteristic peaks of organic groups of the side reaction products appeared at the electrode interface after cycling, with 1680, 1450, 1300, and 1680 cm−1 correlating with C = O, –CO3 2–, C–O, and CH2–OH, respectively [42]. The disappearance of TM-O vibrations between 570–610 cm−1 also indicates the gradual thickening process of the interfacial side-reaction phase of the SC-NCM811 cathodes [43]. Furthermore, the phase mixing states determined by d2 Q dV −2 are consistent with the rock-salt phase present in the electrode materials. The critical “zeros” of the phase transition (M and H2) can be found when the d2 Q dV −2 value is zero, compared to the phase transition interval diagrams observed by dQ dV −1 charge/discharge curves. In addition, we found a tendency for the “zero” point to deviate from its original position in the d2 Q dV −2 discharge curves of conventional UCVs aging cycles (shown in Fig. 4c and Figs. S3–S7b). The mathematical meaning of the “zero” deviation trend is that the function curve is monotonic over this voltage range, i.e., the phase transition shifts from an ordered state to a mixed disordered state. The different offset states from the eigenvalues of the “zeros” can be classified as offset to the left, offset from the zeros, and disappearance of the zeros, corresponding to less defective, more defective, and structurally disordered crystal structures, respectively. Therefore, the “zeros” point of the d2 Q dV −2 discharge curves can be used to rapidly determine the disorder of the crystal structure of the layer-structured electrode materials, which also provides new ideas for rapid sorting of spent electrode materials. Based on the above analysis, the phase evolution and the corresponding capacity decay mechanism of SC-NCM811 electrodes with different UCVs are shown in Fig. 5 . The different phase transition ranges are identified by the “zero” point of the second-order differential capacity of the charge/discharge curve. As lithium ions begin to detach from the H1 phase, the crystal structure transforms into M phase with low symmetry, which maintains the structural stability through lithium vacancy ordering. Experiencing M phase transition, the crystal structure returns to the original H2 phase. During the transformation process in the highly delithiated process (H2 + H3a), the rapid shrinkage of the crystal cell makes it easy to generate stress and strain in the crystal structure. The cut-off voltage continues to increase, making it possible to highly delithiated (H3b). As lithium ions begin to embed, the single-crystal material undergoes almost the opposite process, except for generating irreversible phases. During the aging cycling process, the capacity degradation of the SC-NCM811 electrodes is mainly dominated by interfacial side reactions. Under conventional UCVs, its capacity decay mainly comes from generating irreversible phase transition within the bulk phase and interfacial side reactions. Under high UCVs, although the irreversible phase transition is intensified, the higher diffusion kinetics imparted by the high voltage results in a lower capacity decay than the conventional UCVs. The crystal structure characteristics of SC-NCM811 electrodes make the primary capacity attenuation mechanism at high UCVs remain phase dominant. The thickening of the passivation layer of the interfacial side reaction products led to a decrease in the interfacial side reaction and also affected the diffusion kinetics of lithium ions. Under ultrahigh UCVs, the irreversible phase transition and the escape of reactive oxygen species intensify the side reaction at the interface, resulting in a drastic phase transition of the layered structure and a rapid decrease in electrochemical capacity. The excellent mechanical strength of the single-crystal structure makes its capacity decay mechanism significantly different from that of polycrystalline materials. Moreover, based on the first order differential capacity identification of the intensity of the phase transition, the second-order differential capacity was extended and applied to the identification of the orderliness of the electrode material crystal structure. These key findings provide insights into single-crystal material capacity degradation, material modification, and electrode failure analysis. 4 Conclusions In this study, based on differential capacity analysis, we analyze the battery performance decay and phase evolution at different UCVs, and reveal the basis of H2-H3 phase for capacity decay and reversibility determination. Combined with the disassembly analysis, the “zero” state of the second-order differential capacity of the discharge curve can be used to identify the crystal structure disorder state of the electrode materials. The capacity decay at low UCVs without H2-H3 phase transition mainly comes from interfacial side reactions and crystal structure fatigue. At high UCVs, the capacity degradation mainly originates from the increase of crystal structure defect phase. Due to the larger crystal size characteristics of single-crystal materials, appropriately high UCVs are favorable to enhance their kinetic and electrochemical properties. Under ultrahigh UCVs, the highly reactive oxygen released from the phase transition of highly delithiated rock-salt exacerbates the interfacial side reactions and electrolyte depletion, resulting in rapid capacity degradation.

        "dc:description": "Single-crystal Ni-rich cathodes are a promising candidate for high-energy lithium-ion batteries due to their higher structural and cycling stability than polycrystalline materials. However, the phase evolution and capacity degradation of these single-crystal cathodes during continuous lithation/delithation cycling remains unclear. Understanding the mapping relationship between the macroscopic electrochemical properties and the material physicochemical properties is crucial. Here, we investigate the correlation between the physical-chemical characteristics, phase transition, and capacity decay using capacity differential curve feature identification and in-situ X-ray spectroscopic imaging. We systematically clarify the dominant mechanism of phase evolution in aging cycling. Appropriately high cut-off voltages can mitigate the slow kinetic and electrochemical properties of single-crystal cathodes. We also find that second-order differential capacity discharge characteristic curves can be used to identify the crystal structure disorder of Ni-rich cathodes. These findings constitute a step forward in elucidating the correlation between the electrochemical extrinsic properties and the physicochemical intrinsic properties and provide new perspectives for failure analysis of layered electrode materials.",
