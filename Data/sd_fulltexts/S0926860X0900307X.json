Graphical abstract Scandium and zinc can efficiently catalyze the solventless reaction of terminal epoxides with carbon dioxide in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) to give the corresponding five-membered cyclic carbonates in very high yields. Scandium can efficiently catalyze the solventless reaction of terminal epoxides with carbon dioxide in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) to give the corresponding five-membered cyclic carbonates in very high yields. Metal-exchanged montmorillonites proved to be an excellent and highly effective solution for the immobilization of Sc and Zn in this reaction. Keywords Scandium Zinc CTAB Montmorillonite Carbon dioxide Cyclic carbonate Epoxide 1 Introduction Organic cyclic carbonates are commercially important compounds that find wide applications as polar aprotic solvents (e.g. in electrolytic elements of lithium secondary batteries, in degreasing, paint stripping, cleaning), as monomers for synthesizing polycarbonates and as chemical intermediates for medicinal and agricultural industry [1,2]. The synthesis of cyclic carbonates from CO2 and epoxides is particularly attractive from an environmental point of view since CO2 is a cheap, non-toxic, non-flammable and readily available C1 building block that can be incorporated in the epoxide molecule without the formation of any side products. Although the production of five-membered cyclic carbonates from CO2 and epoxides has been industrialized since the 1950s and uses inexpensive catalysts such as KI [3], the current processes still suffer from major disadvantages such as high reaction temperatures (180–200°C), high pressures (50–80atm) [4] and stoichiometric amounts of activating reagents. Therefore, a large number of studies have been devoted in the last decades to the development of new catalytic systems for the fixation of CO2 for synthesis of cyclic carbonates. Recent developments include porphyrin [5], phthalocyanin [6], Salen [7–14] transition metal complexes, metal salts [15], ionic liquids [16–18], oxychlorides [19], metal oxides [20–22], zeolites [23,24], and so on. Generally, a two-component system comprising both a Lewis acid and a Lewis base seems to be necessary to achieve high yields and high selectivities of cyclic carbonates. Various reports of such systems were published and among them zinc halides, as the Lewis acid coupled with onium or phosphonium salts, as the Lewis base proved to be a major success [25,26]. Intrigued by these results, we decided to investigate the ability of other metal centers to function as the Lewis acidic component. It is well known that metal triflates, and in particular scandium triflate are strong Lewis acids. To the best of our knowledge, this type of catalysts has never been explored for this reaction. Herewith we report for the first time the solventless synthesis of cyclic carbonates from carbon dioxide and epoxides in the presence of a highly efficient bi-component catalytic system composed of scandium triflate and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (Scheme 1 ). 2 Experimental 2.1 Immobilization of the metal triflate catalysts All metal-exchanged montmorillonite (mont.) samples were prepared according to a previously published method [27]. In a standard procedure, 1.5g of Na+-mont (Apache County, Arizona, USA; CEC=1mmol/g) was stirred with 5×10−3 M of Sc(OTf)3 solution in water (100ml) at 50°C for 24h. The suspension obtained was filtrated and washed thrice with 100ml of distilled water and then dried at 110°C for 48h to give a light grey powder. The ytterbium, zinc and magnesium exchanged montmorillonites and CTAB-mont were prepared following the same procedure. XRD measurements were carried out on a STOE STADI P transmission diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ =1.54nm) measuring between 1 and 78° 2θ. Polymer-bound scandium(III) bis(trifluoromethanesulfonate) (Sc-polymer) was purchased from Sigma–Aldrich. The support is a macroporous polystyrene (30–60 mesh size), with a Sc loading of 0.5–1.5mmol/g. 2.2 Catalytic measurements The coupling reactions of CO2 with various epoxides were carried out in small stainless-steel autoclaves (10ml inner volume) equipped with a magnetic bar and a temperature-controlled electrical heater. In a typical reaction, 1,2-epoxyoctane (EO), cetyltributylammonium bromide (25mg) and the respective catalysts (see Tables 1–3 and Fig. 1 ) were charged into the autoclave, which was then saturated with CO2 under a pressure of 2MPa at room temperature. The reaction mixture was heated to the designated temperature and magnetically stirred for 4h. Then the reactor was cooled at 0°C in an ice-water bath and the remaining CO2 was carefully released. The liquid reaction mixture was diluted in THF and analyzed with a HP 5890 GC equipped with a flame-ionization detector and a HP-1 capillary column (30m×0.25mm). The reaction products were identified by GC-MS using an Agilent 5973 Network Mass Selective Detector coupled to an Agilent 6890N GC with HP5MS capillary column (30m×0.25mm). 2.3 Heterogeneity test Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) was used for the determination of the Sc and Zn leaching from the solid catalysts into the reaction mixture. The ICP-AES measurements were performed on a Jobin Yvon Ultima atomic emission spectrometer, equipped with a Meinhard concentric glass nebulizer (uptake1.0 SLPM: 0.9ml/min). A wavelength of 361.384nm was used for Sc and of 213.856nm (sensitivity range 0.2 ppb) for Zn. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Catalyst screening In a first step, a series of metal and non-metal triflates were screened in combination with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as the cocatalyst. The results are summarized in Table 1. For safety reasons, 1,2-epoxyoctane was chosen as a model substrate. The reactions were conducted in the absence of any solvent. While only a low yield of product was obtained with CTAB alone (entry 1), almost complete conversion of the epoxide was achieved in the presence of small amounts of scandium triflate (entry 2). Moreover, the selectivity to cyclic carbonate improved upon scandium addition from 90% with CTAB alone, to 98%. The main side products were octanal and 2-octanone, formed due to the isomerisation of the epoxide. Trace amounts of 1,2-octanediol were also detected (Scheme 2 ). The identity of cyclic carbonates and of the side products was confirmed by GC-MS. Compared with scandium triflate, lanthanide triflates were clearly less reactive, with a 70% and 81% yield of cyclic carbonate for Yb(OTf)3 and La(OTf)3, respectively. In agreement with the literature results, zinc, this time in the form of zinc triflate proved to be an excellent catalyst for this reaction (entry 5). The triflates of other bivalent metals such as magnesium and tin displayed a lower catalytic activity, the former being significantly more reactive than the latter (entries 6, 7). Since the choice of a non-metal catalyst is very attractive from the green chemistry point of view, the activity of a Lewis acid non-metal triflate, namely tert-butyldimethylsilyl triflate (TBDMST) was also tested (entry 8). However, this catalyst proved to be inferior to the metal triflates both in terms of activity and cyclic carbonate selectivity. Summarizing, among the catalysts tested, scandium and zinc triflates gave the best results. 3.2 Optimization of the reaction conditions In order to select the optimum reaction conditions, the influence of various reaction parameters such as temperature, the amount of catalyst and cocatalyst, CO2 pressure and time was investigated. (Fig. 1a–d) Although a high conversion of the epoxide to the corresponding cyclic carbonate is achieved at 100°C, a temperature of 120°C is necessary for the completion of the reaction (Fig. 1a). From a practical point of view, temperatures below 100°C are not particularly attractive since the cycloaddition is highly exothermic and effective heat removal is fundamental to save energy. Thus, for the recovery of the reaction heat as steam, reaction temperatures lower than 100°C will have as a result low heat exchange efficiencies [3]. Next, the effects of the amount of catalyst and co-catalyst were examined. Although very good results (93% EO conversion, 98% cyclic carbonate selectivity) were obtained even for a very small amount of 0.003g of catalyst, a sufficient amount of 0.005g scandium triflate, or 0.13mole %, was found to be required to maximize the yield of cyclic carbonate. A more dramatic effect was noted in the case of the co-catalyst: by reducing the amount of CTAB to 0.0125g a drop in conversion to 50% was observed. In contrast, the difference between reactions in which 0.02g and 0.025g of CTAB were used is very small (Fig. 1b). Remarkably, CO2 pressure had little effect on the cyclic carbonate yield at 120°C in the range of 10–20 atm (Fig. 1c). The influence of the reaction time was studied by performing reactions at 2, 3 and 4h. Within 2h, the yield in cyclic carbonate reached 87% and increased up to 4h when complete epoxide conversion was achieved (Fig. 1d). It is important to note that none of the parameters discussed above had any influence on the selectivity to cyclic carbonate. 3.3 Coupling of CO2 with terminal epoxides In order to survey the applicability of the catalysts to other epoxides, the reaction of CO2 with a series of terminal oxiranes under the optimized conditions was examined (Table 2). While excellent yields and very high selectivities to cyclic carbonates were obtained for linear chain epoxides such as 1,2-epoxyoctane and 1,2-epoxydecane (entries 1 and 2), less satisfactory results were found for more sterically hindered compounds, namely cyclohexeneoxide and 2-methyl-2-vinyloxirane (entries 3 and 4). 3.4 Reaction in the presence of the immobilized catalysts Since scandium triflate is a fairly expensive compound, its immobilization on a solid support is a crucial step towards easier recovery and reutilization of the catalyst and implicitly, reduced costs. Thus, two immobilized scandium catalysts have been tested in the reaction of CO2 with 1,2-epoxyoctane: a commercially available polymer supported scandium triflate catalyst (Sc-polymer) and a scandium exchanged montmorillonite (Sc-mont), prepared according to a previously published method [27]. The main results of these tests are presented in Table 3. Compared to the reaction with CTAB alone, Sc-polymer performs quite well with 60% yield of cyclic carbonate obtained in 4h, using 0.005g of catalyst, but it is considerably less reactive than its homogeneous counterpart (entries 1–3). By increasing the amount of catalyst to 0.01g, the yield of cyclic carbonate was increased to 74% (entry 4). A poor yield of cyclic carbonate was obtained when an immobilized form of CTAB on montmorillonite was employed together with Sc-polymer, indicating that an intimate contact between the ammonium salt and the scandium catalyst is needed in order to obtain good results (entry 5). On the other hand, Sc-mont (0.005g, Sc: 1.66μmol) exhibited a very high catalytic activity, comparable with the reaction with Sc(OTf)3 in homogeneous phase, even if the latter used 10μmoles of Sc (entry 6). Again the activity was much enhanced by increasing the amount of Sc-mont to 0.01g (entry 7). Almost full selectivity to cyclic carbonates was obtained. Several other metal-exchanged montmorillonites such as ytterbium, magnesium and zinc montmorillonites were also successfully tested for this reaction (entries 9–11). The starting material itself, the sodium exchanged montmorillonite presented a relatively low activity (entry 8). With the exception of Mg-mont where a slight decline in activity was noticed (entry 10), the catalytic activity of the metal cations was preserved for Zn-mont (entry 11) or even slightly improved for Yb-mont (entry 9) upon immobilization, suggesting a very good dispersion of the metal on the outer surface of the clay and a close proximity of CTAB and scandium. Indeed, XRD data revealed a shift of the d(001) diffraction peak of montmorillonite from 5.8° 2θ to less than 3°, indicating an increase of the interlayer space due to CTAB intercalation (Fig. 2 ). In order to test the heterogeneity of the immobilized metal montmorillonites, the reaction mixture was separated from the catalyst by careful centrifugation and analyzed with ICP-AES. A very small amount of 0.3% of total Sc was found in the solution in the case of Sc-mont. As the activity is comparable for the immobilized Sc and for the homogeneous Sc, it is unlikely that this small % contributes to an appreciable extent to the observed activity. This indicates that the reaction with Sc-mont is essentially heterogeneous in nature. Similar analyses for Zn-mont catalyzed reactions showed that there was somewhat more leaching for Zn (between 0.6 and 5%) than for Sc. 3.5 Reaction mechanism As previously proposed in literature, both a Lewis acid (LA) and a Lewis base (LB) are probably required for the activation of CO2 and epoxide to afford cyclic carbonates [16]. The LA is responsible for the epoxide activation, while the LB acts as a nucleophile to open the epoxide ring. Similarly, it is proposed that the reaction is initiated by the coordination of the epoxide on Sc, as the Lewis acidic site, followed by the attack of the LB at the least hindered C atom of the epoxide ring. In the homogeneous reaction, bromide acts as the LB; in the heterogeneous reaction, a participation of surface groups of the montmorillonite cannot be excluded. The resulting alkoxide intermediate reacts with carbon dioxide to give the corresponding cyclic carbonate after an intramolecular Sn2 process (Scheme 3 ). 4 Conclusions In conclusion, a new, simple, very efficient and highly selective scandium catalyst for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates from CO2 and oxiranes is reported. Cyclic carbonates were successfully obtained in very high yields using scandium triflate in conjunction with CTAB, in mild reaction conditions and in the absence of any solvent. Ion-exchanged montmorillonites proved to be an excellent and highly effective solution for the immobilization of scandium and zinc. Acknowledgements Angelica Ion is grateful to the K.U.
