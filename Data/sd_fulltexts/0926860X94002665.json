In spite of the similar chemical composition and oxidation number of chromium, these catalysts exhibit considerable differences in alkene conversion in the presence of hydrogen. Alkene conversion further depends on the type of alkene used as well as on the hydrogen pressure. Besides hydrogenation, alkenes undergo oligomerization up to a certain degree. An increase in hydrogen pressure leads to an increase in conversion of alkenes and a rise in the yield of saturated hydrocarbons, while the yield of oligomers is slightly reduced. Our results show that metathesis reactions do not contribute to oligomer formation. Keywords: Calcination; Chromium/silica; Cyclohexene; Hexene; Hydroconversion; Octene 1. Introduction For many years, supported chromium catalysts have been applied in industry in different catalytic processes, mainly in polymerization of alkenes. This reaction has been widely discussed and a summary of the experimental work performed can be found in review papers [ 1-3 ]. The aim of those investigations was to find new highly active catalysts and to explain the reaction mechanism of catalysts already in use. One of the issues, however, that require further study is the effect of hydrogen on the course of the oligomerization reaction. It was found earlier that addition of hydrogen Ziegler- Natta polymerization of alkenes influences the molecular weight of the polymer [4,5 ]. Similar studies performed with Phillips catalysts, i.e. Cr/SIO2, gave ambig- uous results. Hogan [6] observed an increase in the melt index of polymers with 0926-860X/95/$09.50 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, Langstein [9] concluded that in the presence of hydrogen the alkene may become hydrogenated which results in lower polymer yields. The aim of this paper therefore is to investigate and to explain the influence of hydrogen on the catalytic conversion of alkenes with Phillips type catalysts. Studies were carried out with two catalysts that vary in their conditions of thermal activation and reduction, which implies that those catalysts should have different structures of surface groups. Three different alkenes were used to examine the influence of chain length and molecular shape (linear alkenes and cycloalkenes) on the course of the reaction. Hydroconversion reactions were run under different hydrogen pressure. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation The silica supported chromium catalysts, labelled Cr(II)/SiO2 (800/350) and Cr(II)/SIO2(500/500) were prepared according to ref. [ 10] in a three step pro- cedure. In the first step the silica support (Merck 7733, 0.2-0.5 mm) was impreg- nated with CrO3 solution (500 g SiO2 + 23 g CrO3 + 1000 cm3 H20), then filtered and dried in vacuo, first at 70 for 15 h and then at 150 for 2 h. During the second step the obtained product was calcined in oxygen flow in a rotary tube at temperatures gradually increasing from room temperature (R.T.) to 800 or to 500. In a third step, the catalysts were reduced with carbon monoxide at 350 or at 500 for 1 h and after cooling to R.T. under argon transferred to Schlenk bottles. 2.2. Chemical analysis The chemical analyses for chromium(II) and chromium (total) were performed potentiometrically using a Potentiograph E 576 (Metrohm, Switzerland) with plat- inum electrode type EA 217 (Metrohm, Switzerland) according to procedures described earlier [ 11 ]. 2.3. UV/Vis reflectance spectra The reflectance spectra of the Cr(II) /SiO2 catalysts were obtained using a Beck- man Spectrophotometer type DK2 in the range of 4000-40 000 cm- ~ (4--40 kK) using quartz cells [ 12]. Z. Sarbak /Applied Catalysis A: General 124 (1995) 245-252 247 2.4. Catalytic activity procedure The hydrogenation of alkenes was carried out in a high pressure steel autoclave, type 10-36.54 (Roth KG, Germany) directly connected to a high pressure hydrogen cylinder with regulator, manometer, and pressure registration equipment. The reac- tion mixture: 1.5 g catalyst, 25 ml pentane as solvent and 20 mmol alkene was placed in a glass beaker with magnetic bar stirrer inside the autoclave; the loading was done under argon atmosphere to prevent any contact with oxygen. The reactions proceeded under a hydrogen pressure of 30 or 50 bar at room temperature for 20 h. 2.5. Estimation of oligomer yield A gravimetric method was applied to measure the amount of oligomer as reaction products. 0.5 cm3 of the liquid reaction product mixture was evaporated at 50 and 10 bar until a constant mass was reached ( +0.3 mg). 2.6. Gas chromatography (GC) analysis Gaseous and liquid reaction products were subjected to GC analysis, using a WCOT-glass capillary column with OV-101 and a Fractovap chromatograph (Carlo Erba, Italy) with a FID detector and temperature programming (60, 10 rain up to 270), and nitrogen as carrier gas (0.5 bar). 2.7. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry ( GC-MS ) analysis Reaction products were analyzed with a Varian MAT CH7 with an electron impact source (70 eV). 2.8. Fourier transform IR (FT-IR) spectroscopy FT-IR spectra of the reaction products were recorded in the range of 800-1700 cm - ~ with a Biorad/Digilab spectrometer FTS 15 / 80. 3. Results and discussion As a result of the applied preparation procedure, catalysts were obtained in which mainly chromium(II) ions were supported on silica. Two catalysts were produced, denoted as (800/350) and (500/500), respectively, by using different thermal activation conditions (800 and 500) and different temperatures (350 and 500, respectively) in the reaction with carbon monoxide. The chemical compositions and oxidation numbers of the catalysts are presented in Table 1. By comparing the 248 Z.

However, UV-Vis spectra of both catalysts shown in Fig. 1 exhibit evident differences in the band locations. For the Cr/SiO2 (800/350) catalyst, four bands at ca. 8, 12, 26 and 38 kK were observed, while for the Cr/SiO2 (500/500) catalyst the two central bands are shifted towards 13 and 29-33 kK, respectively. The first two bands are assigned to a d-d transition of Cr2 complexes, while the latter two are correlated to a strong ligand charge transfer (LCT) [ 12-14].

Sarbak / Applied Catalysis A: General 124 (1995) 245-252 249 of the shapes of these bands suggests the presence of more than one Crn surface species. Thus, it can be assumed that in spite of the similar chemical composition of the two catalysts, they contain Cr~I ions in at least two different coordinatively unsaturated forms. The above results led us to expect some differences in the activity of both catalysts. It clearly follows from Table 2 that at room temperature in the range of hydrogen pressures studied, sample (800/350) is more active in alkene hydrocon- version compared with sample (500/500). The above data also suggest that hydrogenation of the double bond is the main reaction, while oligomerization is evidently less favoured under the experimental conditions applied. The oligoalkenes formed in modest yields were characterized by their IR spectra. Both the location of particular bands and their intensities are typical for the tacticity of the oligomer systems [ 15,16]. Two characteristic IR spectra of poly- l-octene are presented in Fig. 2. They show absorption bands at 968 and 1135-1140 cm-l which are typical for the atactic polymer [17], while there are no bands that can be attributed to the isotactic polymer. The catalytic alkene hydrogenation also depends on hydrogen pressure (Table 2). An increase in hydrogen pressure causes an increase in the concentration of the respective saturated hydrocarbons in the product mixture. On the basis of the analysis of linear alkenes we can see that an increase in hydrogen pressure leads to a decrease in oligomer formation yield, while in the case of a cyclic alkene a slight increase in oligomer formation is observed. An interesting example of the above was noticed for the reaction with cycloh- exene proceeding in the presence of the Cr/SiO2 (800/350) catalyst, where for the range of hydrogen pressures applied, this reagent undergoes a complete hydro- genation.

For all the studied alkenes, the main reaction is hydrogenation. Yet, in the case of linear alkenes relatively more oligomers are formed on the Cr/SiO2(800/500) catalyst than on the (500/500) catalyst (unlike for cyclohexene, where in both cases low, but comparable amounts of oligomers were formed). The data given in Table 2 show that from 0.3% of the cyclohexene was oligo- merized on both the examined catalysts at a hydrogen pressure of 60 bar. The products obtained might be artefacts from some impurities or the reaction may proceed on Cr-free support. However, more experimental evidence is required to verify one of the above hypotheses. The degree of hydroconversion is also affected by the type of alkene used. The data collected in Table 2 imply that for linear alkenes both hydrogenation and oligomerization proceed with higher yield for 1-octene than for 1-hexene. On the other hand, conversion of cyclohexene on the Cr/SiO2(800/350) catalyst is com- Z. Sarbak /Applied Catalysis A.\" General 124 (1995) 245-252 251 plete, while on the Cr/SiO2(500/500) catalyst cyclohexene is less reactive. On both catalysts the linear 1-alkenes exhibit considerable reactivity. Catalytic hydroconversion gives certain, yet small amounts of oligomers. Their composition for each of the applied catalysts is different and depends on the reagent employed. Generally, in the case of linear hydrocarbons we obtain linear oligomers. However, in the case of cyclic hydrocarbons, the structure of the oligomers is difficult to describe. Specific data on the composition of the oligomers are presented in Table 3. Both catalysts studied take part in oligomer formation: for 1-hexene and the Cr/SiO2 (800/350) catalyst, the C16H34 and CHI4H3o oligomers dominate, while in the presence of the Cr/SiO2(500-500) catalyst, C39H8o is mainly formed. For linear alkenes, the oligomers formed are hydrogenated oligomer C t2, C42 and C66 for l-hexene and C4o for 1-octene, while other oligomers may be products resulting from complex successive reactions, involving most probably double-bond isomerization and/or skeletal isomerization. In the case of oligomerization of cyclohexene, the products are more complicated. It is expected for some time that compounds with a double bond may on catalysts undergo a metathesis reaction. Therefore, the obtained products were also analyzed as to what compounds were present. In the case of 1-hexene and l-octene, identi- fication of 6-decene and 7-tetradecene as the primary metathesis products or their isomers was expected. However, these products were not formed at all, neither were secondary metathesis products identified. Thus, we can eliminate the metath- esis reaction as one of the ways of oligomer formation under the applied conditions.

Conclusion Samples of Cr(II)/SiO2 catalysts prepared under different calcination temper- atures (800 and 500) and reaction temperatures with carbon monoxide (350 and 500) show a similar chemical composition and a similar oxidation number of chromium. However, they contain Crn ions in different coordinatively unsaturated forms. Sample (800/350) is more active in alkene hydroconversion when compared to sample (500/500). Hydrogenation of the double bond is preferred above oligo- merization. An increase in hydrogen pressure caused an increase in the conversion of alkenes and in the yield of saturated hydrocarbons. Simultaneously, the yield of oligomers was reduced for linear alkenes and slightly increased for cyclic alkenes. However, relatively more oligomers are formed on catalyst Cr(II)/SIO2 (800/350) as compared to Cr(II)/SIO2(500/500). For linear hydrocarbons, 1-octene is more reactive towards hydrogenation and oligomerization than 1-hexene. The composi- tion of the oligomers depends on the catalyst type as well as on the kind of alkene. A metathesis reaction as one of the ways of oligomer formation of the examined alkenes could be excluded.
