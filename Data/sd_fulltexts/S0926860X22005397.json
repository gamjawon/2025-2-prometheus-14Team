Dual active sites from acidic zeolite and Pd are not only capable of catalyzing multiple type of reactions, but could also generate unique functions owing to the synergy between metals and acidic sites. However, there are only a few reports on the investigation of the synergy of acid/Pd dual sites in TS-1. Herein, TS-1 confined Pd catalyst with mesoporous silica shell (Pd@TS-1 @meso-SiO2) has been successfully synthesized and its synergy effect contributes to the enhanced conversion rate (19.2%) and selectivity (74.7%) on styrene oxidation. The interaction between Pd and TS-1 has been investigated by EPR and 1H NMR techniques, the experimental measurements show an obvious change in the signal distribution of weakly acidic terminal hydroxyls and hydrogen-bonding silanols. The schematic illustration of selective styrene oxidation in the model of Pd@TS-1 @meso-SiO2 is proposed to clarify the synergistic effect on styrene oxidation between TS-1 and Pd nanoparticles at an atomic-/nanoscale. Graphical Abstract TS-1 confined Pd catalyst with mesoporous silica shell show enhanced conversion rate and selectivity to benzaldehyde in styrene oxidation owing to the synergy effect of Pd and acid sites in TS-1. ga1 Keywords TS-1 Pd cluster Styrene oxidation Hierarchical structure Synergistic effect Confinement effect Data Availability Data will be made available on request. 1 Introduction Selective oxidation is one of the most significant reaction types for the synthesis of chemicals, for which Pd nanometals have been comprehensively explored as an efficient catalyst [1–4]. Due to the high cost of Pd, reducing the size of Pd to nanoscale and increasing its dispersion on porous supports are commonly applied by different synthesis technologies to maximize the exposed sites of the nanometal and enhance the accessibility for efficient catalysis conversion [5–8]. In this regard, zeolites are promising candidates owing to their high surface area, excellent stability and shape selectivity [9–13]. Notably, dual active sites from acidic zeolite and Pd are not only capable of catalysing multiple types of reactions, but could also provide unique functions owing to the interaction between acidic sites and noble metals [14,15]. The beauty of this synergy effect between confined Pd nanometals and zeolite framework is that it could affect the property of acid sites and change the electronic structure of Pd [16,17]. Titanium silicalite-1 (TS-1) has gained great attention as an effective catalyst for liquid-phase oxidation with H2O2 as oxidant [18–21]. Previous reports demonstrate that introduction of noble metals such as Au into TS-1 could enhance the oxidation performance, and adjustment of acidic sites in TS-1 could greatly affect the distribution of products for high selectivity [22–24]. Therefore, a combination of noble metals and acidic sites would be an elegant design of TS-1 catalysts with enhanced activity and selectivity during catalytic oxidation. However, the study on the combination of acid sites and noble metals in TS-1 are rarely reported until now [25], especially an in-depth understanding of their synergistic effect. Core-shell nanostructures are often used to prevents the active site against leaching [26,27]. Mesoporous silica is chosen as the shell for its excellent physiochemical stability and unique mesoporous structure, which could enable the accessibility of reactants to the core [28,29]. Herein, a core-shell structured catalyst with dual active sites (Pd and acidic sites) (designated as Pd@TS-1 @meso-SiO2) has been designed by confined synthesis. Pd@TS-1 @meso-SiO2 catalyst obtained show a high activity, selectivity and stability in styrene oxidation. The mechanism of the synergistic catalysis has been systematically studied and is presented. 2 Experimental 2.1 Materials and reagents Tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS, 98%), tetrabutyl titanate (TBOT, 98.0%), tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH, 2.0 M in H2O, cosolvent: ∼18% methanol), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, ≥99%), sodium tetrachloropalladate (Na2PdCl4, 98%), dodecane (GC) (Aladdin, Shanghai). Ammonium hydroxide aqueous solution (NH3·H2O, AR), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, AR), n-hexane (AR), Styrene (AR), acetone (AR), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 30 wt% aqueous solution), nitric acid (HNO3, AR), hydrochloric acid (HCl, AR) and dichloromethane (AR) (Sinopharm, Shanghai). Water used in this work is deionized by a water purifier. 2.2 Characterization Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken with a Hitachi S4800 electron microscope. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images and corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were taken with a FEI Talos microscope. X-ray diffraction (XRD) powder patterns were collected with a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm, 40 kV and 40 mA). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra was recorded with a BRUKER VERTEX 80 v. The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were collected with a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 M system. (Samples were degassed at 100 °C with evacuation for 12 h before the measurements.) The pore sizes were obtained by Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of the samples were obtained with a ULVAC-PHI Quantera II by a monochromated Al-Kα X-ray source, meanwhile, binding energies of all samples were adjusted to the C1s peak at 284.8 eV. The diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (DR UV–vis) spectra was recorded with a Lambda 750 S. NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) was tested by Micromeritics Instrument Corporation-AutoChem II 2920 system. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements were performed at the X-band with a JEOL FA 2000 spectrometer. 1H MAS and 2D 1H DQ-SQ NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker AVANCE-III 500 spectrometer (Detailed test conditions for EPR and NMR are the same as our previous work [15]). The conversion ratio of substrate and the selectivity ratio of target products were authenticated with gas chromatography (GC/FID, Shimadzu GC-2010 pro) equipped with a HP-5 capillary column. The identification of the reactants and main products are based on the match of rentation time with standard samples on a GC-MS system. The inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) was taken with a Prodigy 7. Before the characterization, samples were dissolved in a certain amount of aqua regia. 2.3 Preparation of catalysts TS-1 was synthesized using one-pot hydrothermal method. In a typical synthesis, 6.24 mL TEOS, 0.204 mL TBOT, 3 mL TPAOH and 5.4 mL H2O are mixed by stirring with a magnetic stirrer for 30 min. The obtained precursor was sealed in a 100 mL capacity Teflon-lined autoclave at 180 °C for 24 h. The solid sample was collected and washed with deionized water for 3 times via centrifugation, followed by drying in air. Finally, the TS-1 was gained by calcination (550 °C in air, 6 h, 3 °C/min). Meso-SiO2 were synthesized using sol-gel method. In a typical synthesis, 2.4 g CTAB, 3 mL NH3·H2O and 6 mL TEOS were added into the solution of 57 g H2O and 57 g DMF and stirred for 3 h. The solid sample was washed with deionized water for 3 times via centrifugation and then dried in air. The meso-SiO2 was obtained by calcination (550 °C in air, 6 h, 3 °C/min). Pd@TS-1 or Pd@meso-SiO2 was synthesized by impregnation method. In a typical synthesis, 138.2 μL Na2PdCl4 solution (0.1 g/mL), 500 mg TS-1 or meso-SiO2 and 20 mL n-hexane were stirred in a 50 mL beaker for half hour. After stirring, the precipitate is separated by centrifugation and dried in air. The Pd@TS-1 or Pd@meso-SiO2 was reduced by reducing gas calcination (200 °C in H2/Ar (10% H2), 2 h, 2 °C/min). TS-1 @meso-SiO2 and Pd@TS-1 @meso-SiO2 were coated by sol-gel method. In a typical synthesis, 500 mg TS-1 or Pd@TS-1 was added into a solution of 110 mL H2O and 55 mL ethanol. After 30 min of ultrasonication, 0.60 g CTAB, 1.25 mL NH3·H2O and 0.75 mL TEOS were dropped into the prepared solution, followed by stirring for 4 h. The solid product was rinsed with water and centrifugation 3 times. Dried in air, the TS-1 @meso-SiO2 and Pd@TS-1 @meso-SiO2 were obtained by calcination (550 °C in air, 6 h, 3 °C/min). 2.4 Catalytic activity and stability measurements The catalytic oxidation experiments of styrene were conducted in a Teflon autoclave reactor of 50 mL capacity with a magnetic stirrer, using H2O2 as oxidant. In a typical oxidation reaction experiment, 50 mg of the catalyst were stirred with 0.5 mL styrene, 0.5 mL dodecane as internal standard, 5 mL acetone as solvent and 1 mL H2O2 at a given temperature of 70 °C. After reaction of 7 h, The products were further extracted by dichloromethane and tested using gas chromatography. 3 Results and discussion The scheme of the synthesis procedure of Pd@TS-1 @meso-SiO2 is shown in Fig. 1a. Na2PdCl4 was firstly impregnated in nanosized TS-1 followed by H2 reduction to obtain Pd@TS-1. The coating of mesoporous silica was achieved by a sol-gel method using CTAB. After removal of CTAB by calcination and further reduction in H2, Pd@TS-1 @meso-SiO2 was obtained. The SEM image of original TS-1 crystals show 200–250 nm uniform particles (Fig. S1a). After impregnated with Pd (Fig. S1b) and coated with mesoporous silica, Pd@TS-1 @meso-SiO2 show sphere-like morphology with size of 250–300 nm (Fig. 1b), and mesoporous SiO2 shell with a thickness of 20–35 nm (Fig. 1c). From the STEM image (Fig. 1c, Fig. S1c) and HAADF-STEM image (Fig. 1d), Pd nanoparticles with average size of 5–10 nm can be observed. The EDX element mappings (Fig. 1e) show that Pd are dispersed uniformly in the TS-1 particle. The XRD pattern of Pd@TS-1 @meso-SiO2 (Fig. S2) show the peaks assigned to MFI structure, as well as weak reflection affiliated with Pd metal (2 theta=40.1°), which further indicates the success encapsulation of Pd. It’s shown in FT-IR spectra (Fig. S3) that the band at 550 cm−1 could be attributed to the asymmetric stretching of five membered rings in the MFI structure [30]. The N2 adsorption isotherms (Fig. S4) demonstrate a decrease in surface area after Pd loading and a further increase in surface area after mesoporous silica coating, with uniform pore distribution of 2.6 nm in Pd@TS-1 @meso-SiO2 (Table S1). XPS is further used to study the chemical environment of the samples (Fig. S5). The two peaks at 343.7 eV (Pd(0)3d3/2) and 337.5 eV (Pd(0)3d5/2) (Fig. S5e, f) in the XPS spectra of Pd@TS-1 indicate the existence of metallic Pd [31]. Notably, no obvious peak is observed in Pd 3d XPS spectra of Pd@TS-1 @meso-SiO2, which is attributed to the complete coating by the silica shell. Similar results are shown in the Ti 2p XPS spectra (Fig. S5d). To further understand the interaction between TS-1 and Pd, various techniques are applied. The UV–vis DRS spectra (Fig. S6) prove the presence of framework Ti in both TS-1 @meso-SiO2 and Pd@TS-1 @meso-SiO2, which indicates that the state of Ti species in the TS-1 framework is not influenced by the introduction of Pd in TS-1 [32]. The presence of available acid sites in Pd@TS-1 @meso-SiO2 is proved by NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) (Fig. S7). The obvious desorption peaks in the range of 50–200 °C and 300–500 °C can be attributed to the weak acid sites and the strong acid sites respectively. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of Pd@TS-1 @meso-SiO2 and Pd@TS-1 show a strong signal at g= 1.998, suggesting the increased number of active free-electrons after the introduction of Pd nanoparticles [33,34]. Solid-state magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR has been widely used to probe the acid sites in zeolites at atomic levels. In particular, two-dimensional (2D) MAS NMR, which is capable of providing a clearer discrimination of resonances than one-dimensional (1D) NMR, is regarded as a versatile tool to the elucidation of complex structures.[35–38] Therefore, 1D 1H MAS NMR and 2D 1H DQ-SQ MAS NMR are performed to investigate the acid sites in Pd@TS-1 @meso-SiO2 quantitatively and qualitatively, and to better understand the effect of Pd on the acid sites. The 1H MAS NMR spectra ( Fig. 2) of TS-1 @meso-SiO2 and Pd@TS-1 @meso-SiO2 show two major peaks at 1.9 ppm and 3.4 ppm, which could be assigned to weakly acidic terminal hydroxyls and hydrogen-bonding silanols, respectively [39–42]. Very interestingly, the ratio of these two peaks in Pd@TS-1 @meso-SiO2 is 0.15, which is 2.14 times lower than for TS-1 @meso-SiO2 (0.33). Considering that the only difference between these two samples is the existence of Pd nanoparticles, it could be deduced that the amount of trapped hydrogen species is significantly increased with the encapsulation of Pd nanoparticles. 2D 1H DQ-SQ MAS NMR provide further information of the interaction of Pd and acid sites in spatial proximity. Pd@TS-1 @meso-SiO2 shows three self-correlation signals at (1.9, 1.9 + 1.9), (3.4, 3.4 + 3.4) and (3.7, 3.7 + 3.7), while TS-1 @meso-SiO2 only shows the self-correlation signals at (1.9, 1.9 +1.9) (Fig. 2c, d). This obvious difference illustrates that the synergy between Pd and TS-1 could contribute to more spatially closed hydrogen species bonded in the framework. The styrene oxidation performance of the samples has been investigated to understand the synergy effect of the active sites on catalytic reactions. For comparison, TS-1, TS-1 @meso-SiO2, Pd@TS-1 and Pd@meso-SiO2 (mesoporous SiO2 microspheres supported Pd via impregnation) have also been studied. As shown in Table 1, the samples with both acid sites and metal sites (Pd@TS-1 @meso-SiO2 and Pd@TS-1) show relatively higher conversion rate (19.2% and 16.3%) than the samples with only Pd (Pd@meso-SiO2, 5.2% and Comm-Pd/C, 13.5%) or Ti-site (TS-1 @meso-SiO2, 15.1% and TS-1, 10.9%), which indicates that the synergy of Pd, resultant acidic sites and Ti sites in TS-1 could improve the performance of the oxidation of styrene. Notably, Pd@TS-1 @meso-SiO2 (entry 1) shows 19.2% conversion ratio of styrene and 74.7% selectivity to benzaldehyde, which is higher than Pd@TS-1 with 16.3% conversion ratio and 66.5% selectivity. This could possibly be due to the enhanced molecular diffusion and better stabilized Pd nanoparticles. Ultimately the stability and recyclability of the Pd@TS-1 @meso-SiO2 catalyst is displayed in entries 1–5. The results show that Pd@TS-1 @meso-SiO2 exhibits a stable conversion ratio of styrene and selectivity to benzaldehyde in five cycles. Moreover, the ICP-AES (Table S2) illustrates that there is nearly no apparent reduction of Pd loading in the sample after recycling. The well-maintained morphology and structure are evidenced by SEM image, XRD pattern and N2 adsorption isotherms (Fig. S8). The high catalytic stability and structural stability of Pd@TS-1 @meso-SiO2 is mainly due to the synergistic effect between confined Pd nanometals and acid sites in TS-1, as well as the mesoporous silica shell that could stabilize the Pd nanometals and prevent its loss in catalytic reactions. Herein, the possible reaction mechanism of synergistic enhancement of Pd@TS-1 @meso-SiO2 for styrene oxidation is proposed ( Scheme 1, Fig.S9). During the reaction, the mesoporous silica with rich hydroxyl groups and high surface area enables fast diffusion of molecules and preventing the Pd nanoparticles from leaching. The adsorbed H2O2 would react with framework Ti species and form TiOOH species [43]. Intermediate product is then obtained from the reaction of TiOOH species and styrene (Scheme 1(i), Fig. S9 (i, ii)). The absorbed hydrogen on Pd and the rich hydrogen bonding due to the acid sites in the framework favor the cleavage of C-C bond by oxidation reaction (Scheme 1 (ii), Fig S9 (iii)). As a result, benzaldehyde would form as the main oxidation product, and formaldehyde is the by-product of the reaction (Fig S9 (iv)). Such a spatial and intimate site distribution would lead to this directional and cascade reaction proposed, and high selectivity of benzaldehyde is achieved. (See Fig. S9 and detailed descriptions of the reaction mechanism in supporting information). 4 Conclusion In summary, a TS-1 confined Pd catalyst with mesoporous silica shell has been successfully designed. It shows great catalytic activity and stability in the reaction of styrene oxidation. The synergistic effect between acid sites in TS-1 and confined Pd nanoparticles has been explored. The catalytic mechanism of Pd@TS-1 @meso-SiO2 has been proposed. In this work, a significant strategy for the design of bifunctional catalysts is provided to obtain high activity and stability.

        "dc:description": "Dual active sites from acidic zeolite and Pd are not only capable of catalyzing multiple type of reactions, but could also generate unique functions owing to the synergy between metals and acidic sites. However, there are only a few reports on the investigation of the synergy of acid/Pd dual sites in TS-1. Herein, TS-1 confined Pd catalyst with mesoporous silica shell (Pd@TS-1 @meso-SiO2) has been successfully synthesized and its synergy effect contributes to the enhanced conversion rate (19.2%) and selectivity (74.7%) on styrene oxidation. The interaction between Pd and TS-1 has been investigated by EPR and 1H NMR techniques, the experimental measurements show an obvious change in the signal distribution of weakly acidic terminal hydroxyls and hydrogen-bonding silanols. The schematic illustration of selective styrene oxidation in the model of Pd@TS-1 @meso-SiO2 is proposed to clarify the synergistic effect on styrene oxidation between TS-1 and Pd nanoparticles at an atomic-/nanoscale.",
