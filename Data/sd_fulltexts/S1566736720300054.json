A zirconium-based metal-organic polyhedron is decorated by Pt nanoparticles with different spatial locations for visible-light-driven H2 production, which makes photocatalytic efficiencies improved on different levels. This work delves into the affinity of electron-transfer path with photocatalytic reactivity and further broadens horizons for porous materials in photocatalysis. Graphical abstract Unlabelled Image Keywords H2 production Metal-organic polyhedron Photocatalysis Water splitting Zirconium 1 Introduction Solar-driven photocatalytic H2 production via water splitting is promoted to become a clean and environment-friendly strategy to address the worldwide environmental and energy issues [1,2]. The crucial challenge of this flourishing technology is to explore rational photocatalysts that can efficiently hinder the recombination of photo-generated electron-hole, which contributes to further proton reduction in specific sites. Given visible-light accounts for nearly half of solar energy, the efficient utilization of visible-light will be great significant in promoting photocatalytic activity [3]. Therefore, the photocatalyst with visible-light absorption and efficient electron-hole separation is valuable for improving H2 production. Porous photocatalysts could suppress the recombination of electron-hole due to the exposed active sites and accessibility to substrate [4]. Recently, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), regarded as an emerging category of crystalline porous materials with high surface area, intriguing structural diversity, and unlimited tunability, have attracted extensive interests and exhibited a variety of applications, especially in photocatalysis [5,6]. Among the diversified MOFs family, zirconium-based metal-organic frameworks (Zr-MOFs) have drawn growing attention because of their inherent ultra stability in aqueous solutions with broad pH ranges, which is ascribed to the robust Zr − O bonds (776 kJ mol−1) [7]. Discrete metal-organic polyhedra (MOPs), constructed through coordiation-driven of the metal ions and organic ligands, have attracted great concern due to the potential applications, such as nanoreactors, adsorption and molecule inclusion [8–10]. However, the applications of most reported MOPs are limited owing to the poor aqueous stability [7,9]. Therefore, MOPs that can remain stable in acid-base solutions are much needed as the majority of applications are performed in aqueous environment, such as catalysis and drug delivery [11]. Inspired by Zr-MOFs, emerging investigations have been devoted to the development of zirconium-based metal-organic polyhedra (Zr-MOPs). From 2013, Yuan and co-workers have reported a series of Zr-MOPs which are made up of three-connected zirconium clusters and diverse carboxylate ligands [7,12–14]. All of these MOPs show excellent stability in aqueous solutions with broad pH values, suggesting the potential as catalysts for long-term catalysis [15]. In 2017, an amino-functionalized Zr-MOP, named as UMOP-1-NH2 (ZrT-1-NH2 in other work), was first reported by Choe and co-workers [16]. The presence of amino group in the H2BDC (1,4-dicarboxybenzene) ligand brings absorption under visible-light, which elevates UMOP-1-NH2 as a preferential candidate for visible-light H2 production catalyst. More recently, Kim and co-workers reported a Zr-MOP constructed by photocatalytic Re units for CO2 reduction [17]. In 2019, our group reported ZrT-1-NH2 as photocatalyst for H2 production for the first time. Compared with UiO-66-NH2, an extended three dimensional Zr-MOF, ZrT-1-NH2 exhibits about 20 times enhancement in photocatalyic activity, shedding light on the application of MOPs in photocatalysis. Besides, the photocatalytic efficiency gets further improved when Pt nanoparticles (NPs) are introduced into the reaction system [18]. In most photocatalytic systems, metal NPs, especially Pt NPs, are served as electron trappers to hinder the recombination of photo-generated electron-hole in order to further enhance photocatalytic efficiency [19–23]. Given most photo-generated electrons will gradually deracinate when they transfer to the surface of the photocatalyst for reaction, a faster capture speed of electrons by trappers is beneficial to promote photocatalytic efficiency [24]. As we know, there are no other related reports on MOPs used for photocatalytic H2 production, especially the detailed investigations about the influence of the spatial location of electron trapper on the photocatalytic activity of MOP-based catalysts. Hence, it will be great significance to explore the effects of spatial location of the electron trappers in the MOP-based photocatalytic system. Herein, we report the effects of spatial location of Pt NPs in ZrT-1-NH2 for photocatalytic H2 production. Pt NPs acting as electron trappers are dispersed into or supported on the surface of ZrT-1-NH2, referred as Pt@ZrT-1-NH2 and Pt/ZrT-1-NH2, respectively. Compared with parent ZrT-1-NH2 (0.5 mmol g−1 h−1), the photocatalytic activities of Pt-decorated ZrT-1-NH2 are both obviously improved under visible-light. Specifically, Pt@ZrT-1-NH2 presents 20 times enhancement in photocatalytic efficiency in comparison with ZrT-1-NH2, directly demonstrating the important influence of the spatial location of Pt NPs. Furthermore, the spatial confinement effect in MOP makes Pt@ZrT-1-NH2 with good photocatalytic stability and recyclability. 2 Experimental section 2.1 Chemicals and instrumentation All chemicals were purchased from Alfa and used as received. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data of ZrT-1-NH2 and Pt@ZrT-1-NH2 were collected by a Bruker Apex-II CCD diffractometer with graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71069 Å) at 293 K. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were carried out through a Siemens D5005 diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å) radiation in the range of 5–30° at a rate of 10°/min. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were tested via a Multilab 2000 (Thermo) spectrometer. The N2 sorption measurements were executed over automatic volumetric adsorption equipment (Belsorp mini II). The UV/Vis absorption spectra were measured on a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrometer in the wavelength range of 200–800 nm. Morphologies of the obtained samples were observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM: Hitachi SU-8010) and transmission electronmicroscopy (TEM: JEOL JEM-2010) equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray. Solid-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were gained with Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian, USA). Elemental analyses were recorded with a Leaman inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectrometer. 2.2 Syntheses of photocatalysts Synthesis of ZrT-1-NH 2 . ZrT-1-NH2, [Cp3Zr3O(OH)3]4[BDC-NH2]6∙Cl4∙4DMF (BDC-NH2 = 2-amino-benzene-1,4-dicarboxylate). Zirconocene dichloride (45 mg, 0.15 mmol) and NH2-H2BDC (36 mg, 0.20 mmol) were mixed in a vial. Then, 0.5 mL DMF and 6 drops of deionized water were added. The resulting mixture was kept at 60 °C for 13 h. Yellow crystals were collected and washed three times with fresh DMF (about 89% yield based on Zirconocene dichloride) [18]. Synthesis of Pt@ZrT-1-NH 2 . Zirconocene dichloride (45 mg, 0.15 mmol) and NH2-H2BDC (36 mg, 0.20 mmol) were mixed in 0.5 mL DMF and 6 drops of deionized water. Subsequently, 3.0, 6.0, 9.0 and 12.0 mg H2PtCl6 were added into the above mixture, respectively. Then, the mixture was heated at 60 °C for 13 h. The mentioned procedures were carried out in dark condition. Yellow crystals were collected and washed three times with DMF. Synthesis of Pt/ZrT-1-NH 2 . 30 mg of pre-synthesized ZrT-1-NH2 and a certain dosage of H2PtCl6 (3.0, 6.0, 9.0 and 12.0 mg) were added into 20 mL DMF, subsequently stirred for 4 h. The above procedures were carried out in dark condition. Yellow powders were collected by centrifugation and washed with DMF for three times. 2.3 Photocatalytic test The photocatalytic H2 production was carried out in a 50-mL sealed quartz tube under stirring and irradiated at λ > 420 nm by a 300 W xenon lamp. The whole reaction was maintained at 35 °C via a water bath. 30 mg photocatalyst was added into 15 mL deionized water and 5 mL MeCN together with 1 mL [1–30] TEA (triethylamine). Then, the suspension was pumped with argon for 30 min to remove air. Finally, the tube equipped with above suspension was beamed by the Xe lamp under stirring. The detection of H2 was executed by the gas chromatography with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). After centrifuged and dried, the photocatalyst was devoted into the repetitive reactions for cycling experiments. 3 Results and discussion ZrT-1-NH2, with V4E6 topology (V = vertex, E = edge), is an independent zirconocene-coordinated tetrahedral polyhedron. The three-connected Zr clusters formed by stepwise hydrolysis of Cp2ZrCl2 act as the vertexes and NH2-H2BDC ligands regard as the tetrahedral edges, together construct a tetrahedron (Fig. S1). Different H2PtCl6 dosages are added into DMF containing Cp2ZrCl2 and NH2-H2BDC ligands to build Pt@ZrT-1-NH2. While, Pt/ZrT-1-NH2 is prepared by an approachable procedure, that is mixing H2PtCl6 and ZrT-1-NH2 together in DMF (Fig. 1 ). Notably, different from noble-metal NPs inside the shell of conventional core-shell structured semiconductor photocatalysts that discourages the accessibility between charge and substrate, Pt NPs injected into the porous ZrT-1-NH2 are widely accessible to protons. Logically, Pt@ZrT-1-NH2 makes photogenerated electrons experience shorter transmission distance and effectively hinders the recombination of electron-hole, contributing to an increased photocatalytic activity than Pt/ZrT-1-NH2 [3]. In parallel, aggregation or leaching of Pt NPs in Pt@ZrT-1-NH2 can be avoided during the photocatalysis, guaranteeing more durable photocatalytic activity than that of Pt/ZrT-1-NH2. Above hypotheses have been confirmed by specific characterizations and experimental results. The phase purity of ZrT-1-NH2, Pt@ZrT-1-NH2 and Pt/ZrT-1-NH2 is confirmed through powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) characterization (Fig. S2(a)). The experimental PXRD patterns are almost consistent with the simulated. No any extra peaks appear after Pt NPs loaded because of the low content, indicating the integrity of ZrT-1-NH2 structure in solution. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations display a cross-section and an overall perspective of the optimized Pt@ZrT-1-NH2 with 4.29 wt% Pt loading and Pt/ZrT-1-NH2 with 4.13 wt% (measured by inductively coupled plasma, ICP), confirming that Pt NPs are encapsuled into or supported on ZrT-1-NH2 (Fig. S3). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations (Fig. S4) exhibit the lattice spacing of 0.23 nm, which is in line with the (111) facet of Pt. The structural integrity and porosity performances of ZrT-1-NH2 after Pt NPs loaded are confirmed via N2 adsorption-desorption measurements (Fig. S2(b)). Compared with the pristine ZrT-1-NH2 (722 m2 g−1), the surface areas of Pt@ZrT-1-NH2 (624 m2 g−1) and Pt/ZrT-1-NH2 (631 m2 g−1) decline slightly. The elements and chemical states of the photocatalysts are studied via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. S2(c)-(d) and S6). The binding energies at 75 and 72 eV are regarded as Pt 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 peaks, strongly proving the existence of metallic Pt in Pt@ZrT-1-NH2 and Pt/ZrT-1-NH2 (Fig. S2(c)-(d)) [25–28]. The UV–Vis spectra for ZrT-1-NH2, Pt@ZrT-1-NH2 and Pt/ZrT-1-NH2 show that the optical feature of ZrT-1-NH2 is ideally inherited by Pt@ZrT-1-NH2 and Pt/ZrT-1-NH2 (Fig. 2(a)). All the photocatalysts possess strong absorption from λ = 350 to 480 nm, together with similar band gap (ca. ~2.5 eV) (Fig. S7). Pt@ZrT-1-NH2 exhibits a more intensive absorption than ZrT-1-NH2 and Pt/ZrT-1-NH2, which can be ascribed to the high intensity scattering in the long wavelengths region generated by tight packing between Pt and ZrT-1-NH2, in accordance with the color variance from pale yellow of ZrT-1-NH2 to dark yellow of Pt@ZrT-1-NH2 (Fig. 2(a) insert) [3,4]. Furthermore, photocurrent responses are performed to evaluate charge-carrier separation efficiency (Fig. 2(b)). Both Pt-decorated ZrT-1-NH2 show increased photocurrent in comparison with the parent ZrT-1-NH2. Pt@ZrT-1-NH2 displays more intensive photocurrent response than Pt/ZrT-1-NH2, indicating there is more efficient charge transfer to Pt NPs in Pt@ZrT-1-NH2. Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectroscopy is carried out to investigate the photoexcited carrier transfer and recombination (Fig. 2(c)). ZrT-1-NH2 shows a strong emission peak, which is mainly due to the fast recombination of photoexcited charge carriers. Compared with ZrT-1-NH2, the PL of Pt-decorated ZrT-1-NH2 shows obvious quenching, which should be attributed to the electron transport from the Zr clusters to the Pt NPs. Moreover, a faster transfer is occurred in Pt@ZrT-1-NH2, leading to a weaker PL intensity than than of Pt/ZrT-1-NH2. These results suggest that Pt NPs encapsulated into the cavity of MOP can trap electrons more efficiently than that Pt NPs supported on the surface of crystal, which greatly suppresses the recombination of electron-hole. Pt-decorated ZrT-1-NH2 for photocatalytic H2 production is cooperated with deionized water, MeCN and TEA at 35 °C (Fig. 3 ). Given by relevant reported work, amine-functionalized organic linker serves as antenna, which is in response to visible light and then transports energy to the Zr clusters efficiently [3,18,29,30]. As Pt-decorated ZrT-1-NH2, Pt NPs can trap the photogenerated electrons generating on the MOP and supply redox reaction sites for the following proton reduction. Compared with the parent ZrT-1-NH2 (0.5 mmol g−1 h−1), Pt/ZrT-1-NH2 exhibits about 2 times enhancement in photocatalytic activity (1.1 mmol g−1 h−1), while, Pt@ZrT-1-NH2 exhibits 20 times enhancement in photocatalytic activity (10.8 mmol g−1 h−1) with the similar Pt content (4.29 wt%) to Pt/ZrT-1-NH2 (4.13 wt%). These results demonstrate that the spatial locations of Pt NPs in ZrT-1-NH2 have great effect on the photocatalytic activity. When Pt NPs are encapsulated into ZrT-1-NH2, effective separation of electron-hole is realized, further promoting the photocatalytic efficiency. Moreover, photocatalytic efficiencies of Pt@ZrT-1-NH2 with different Pt loadings all exceed those of Pt/ZrT-1-NH2 (Fig. S8). Indeed, comparative experiments using UiO-66-NH2 as photocatalyst illuminate that discrete ZrT-1-NH2 contributes to more targeted electrons transfer, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic activity (Fig. S9). Recycling experiments are carried out to investigate the photocatalytic durability of the catalysts. For ZrT-1-NH2, H2 production efficiency remains nearly constant over five successive runs (Fig. S10) and PXRD patterns are consistent with the original PXRD (Fig. S11), which are owing to the water-stability of ZrT-1-NH2. However, the H2 production activity of Pt/ZrT-1-NH2 has decreased continually from the second run, which is most likely to be caused by Pt NPs leaching from the surface of crystal. This assumption is further confirmed by the ICP results, which directly illustrates that Pt NPs on the crystal surface without strong protection are easy to leak. As a comparation, Pt NPs encapsulated into crystal lattice are effectively restricted due to the confinement effect of MOP structure, resulting in steady photocatalytic efficiency over five recycling runs (Table S1). According to above results, reasoned photocatalytic mechanism is proposed as Fig. S12. When light irradiating, amino groups as photon antennas are excited to generate electron-hole and then photogenerated electrons directly transfer to the Zr clusters. Given Pt is a suitable electron trap with low overpotential, electrons detained in the Zr clusters are subsequently trapped by Pt NPs via the Schottky junction. Due to a shorter transport distance suffering for electrons that transfer to the internal Pt NPs and more easy accessibility to protons of electrons immobilized in the internal Pt NPs, Pt@ZrT-1-NH2 dramatically improves charge-carrier utilization and further enhances photocatalytic efficiency. 4 Conclusions In conclusion, this work first investigates the influence of spatial location of Pt NPs in Zr-MOP for photocatalysis, where Pt NPs are immobilized inside or supported on the surface, to give Pt@ZrT-1-NH2 and Pt/ZrT-1-NH2, respectively. Both Pt-decorated ZrT-1-NH2 exhibit much more efficient photocatalytic H2 production activity than ZrT-1-NH2 and Pt@ZrT-1-NH2 shows 10 times enhancement in reactivity than Pt/ZrT-1-NH2. For Pt@ZrT-1-NH2, shorter transfer path of electrons from MOP to internal Pt NPs and more easy accessibility to protons for electron-injected Pt NPs within MOP are realized, leading to more remarkable suppression of electron-hole recombination and logically higher photocatalytic efficiency. Moreover, Pt@ZrT-1-NH2 exhibits superior photocatalytic recyclability owing to the spatial confinement effect of the MOP, unlike the leaching of Pt NPs supported on the surface of crystal leading to a poor cycling performance. This work not only enhances the understanding on the significant influence of electron-transfer path on metal NPs-decorated MOP as photocatalyst, but also broadens the thought of MOP-based and porous material-based photocatalysts.
