Tel.: +81-92-583-7526; fax: +81-92-573-0342 Supported Cu catalysts were investigated for CO removal in a gas mixture after methanol steam reforming. Removal of CO in the post-reforming gas was effectively promoted by the addition of oxygen in the gas mixture. Not only water gas shift reaction (WGSR; CO+H2O→CO2 +H2) but also CO oxidation reaction (CO+1/2O2 →CO2) was effective in reducing the CO concentration. Although, H2 oxidation also proceeded by added oxygen, the concentration of CO significantly decreased without consuming a large amount of H2 with an increase in oxygen concentration. The equilibrium concentration obtained from thermodynamic data indicates that the reaction is desirable at lower temperatures. Cu/Al2O3–ZnO demonstrated an excellent activity for catalytic removal of CO by oxygen-assisted WGSR. The activity was enhanced without increasing H2 conversion by employing longer contact time. These results indicate that the design of an active shift/oxidation catalyst operative at 100–150°C is a possible method for removal of very small amounts of CO in the reformed fuel. Keywords CO shift reaction CO oxidation Cu catalyst 1 Introduction Hydrogen is regarded as one of the most important energy sources to produce heat, electricity, power energy and industries in the near future. Hydrogen energy can be efficiently converted into mechanical or electrical energy with production of only water by combustion. Hydrogen, though promising as a fuel, is not suitable for transportation as a compressed gas or a liquid due to its low boiling point. Therefore, on board-conversion of carbonaceous fuel to hydrogen is suggested and has been extensively investigated. Methanol is regarded as the most desirable chemical existing as liquid at ambient temperatures [1–4]. Methanol is used for fuel cell-powered vehicles and as a source of chemical products due to its high energy density, ease of transport, absence of sulfur contamination, and possibility of conversion at moderate temperatures (200–400°C) [5,6]. Steam reforming of methanol is one important method for on-site hydrogen generation systems. In addition, the reformed gas is benign for the environment because no NO x , SO x and dust have been produced in the process. One efficient utilization of methanol is an application to polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) with a proton exchange membrane after catalytic conversion into hydrogen. PEFC has been studied as an ideal on-site power source for vehicles and/or small facilities because of some advantages, such as compact size, operation at low temperatures (<120°C) and high pressures, and a high power density [7–10]. Steam reforming of methanol is a well-established technology for hydrogen production. However, in case of the application to PEFC, a small amount of CO in the reformed fuel deteriorates the Pt electrode and the cell performance [11–13]. Although CO-tolerant electrodes such as Pt–Ru electrode have been developed, the allowable level of CO concentration is still low. It is thus necessary to remove trace amounts of CO in the reformed gas. Many researchers have struggled to solve this problem over noble metals and/or base metals [14–22]. CO oxidation effectively proceeds on precious metal catalysts only in a narrow temperature range. Thus, it is sometimes difficult to control the reactor temperature owing to the quite calorific nature of the reaction. The dry reaction condition is thermodynamically unfavorable for removal of CO at a high concentration level. Water gas shift reaction (WGSR) is a preferable reaction for CO removal due to a lower calorific value than the oxidation. The WGSR has been also regarded as a CO removal process for reformed gas before the preferential oxidation of CO. We have previously reported that an addition of a small amount of O2 to the reformed fuel is effective in promoting CO removal by WGSR [23]. In this study, CO removal was carried out over some Cu-supported oxide catalysts by a coupled WGSR (CO+H2O→CO2 +H2) and CO oxidation (CO+1/2O2→CO2) in the presence of a large amount of H2O and H2. The effects of O2 addition to the reformed gas were investigated and discussed. 2 Experimental Cu/MO x –M′O y (M, M′=Al, Cr, Mg, Mn and Zn; M/M′=1) catalysts and M″–Cu/Al2O3–ZnO (M″=Au, Pd, Pt, Rh and Ru) catalysts were prepared by co-precipitation with aqueous NH3. Nitrates and/or chlorides of Cu, M, M′ and M″ were mixed in distilled water and precipitated with aqueous ammonia at pH=7. Then the resultant gel was separated by filtration and washed. Cu/MO x –M′O y catalysts were then dried and calcined at 500°C for 3h. Cu/Al2O3–ZnO (Al2O3 :ZnO=6:4; weight ratio) catalysts were also prepared by the same procedure. The catalysts were calcined at three different temperatures (500, 700 and 900°C) for 3h. A specific surface area of catalysts was determined by the BET method using nitrogen adsorption. The crystalline phase of catalysts was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). CO removal reaction over copper-mixed oxide catalysts was examined in a conventional flow reactor at atmospheric pressure. Each sample was reduced at 400°C in a hydrogen flow prior to the catalytic reaction. A gaseous mixture of H2, CO, H2O, CO2 and N2 (balance), as methanol steam reforming model gas, was supplied to the catalyst bed at a space velocity of 6400h−1. The gas phase composition after CO removal reaction was analyzed by gas chromatography. A Molecular Sieve 4A column was used for separation of H2, N2 and O2, active carbon to separate CO2 from other inorganic gases, Porapak Q for organic products (CH3OH and CH4) and Porapak T for CO. For the quantitative analysis of very small amount of CO, methanation of CO has been carried out by a Ni catalyst before supplying to a FID detector. The conversions of CO and H2 were defined as follows: (1) COconv.(%)=(F CO in−F CO out)×100/F CO in (2) H 2 conv.(%)=(F H 2 in−F H 2 out)×100/F H 2 in Where Fi in and Fi out denote flow rates of ith species at the inlet and outlet of the reactor, respectively. A commercial electrolysis cell of water (GS Battery) was used to evaluate V–I characteristics of PEFC by its reverse operation. Power generation characteristics of PEFC and their deterioration by CO were measured by using a conventional flow system with the following cell components, (3) H 2–CO–H 2 O (reformedfuel), Pt/electrolyte/Pt,air A gaseous mixture of H2–CO–H2O was fed to the anode and air to the cathode. Before being fed to each electrode, the gases were humidified with distilled water at 80°C. Power generation characteristics and the voltage–current density (V–I) curve of PEFC were obtained by using a conventional flow system at 80°C and atmospheric pressure. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Steam reforming of methanol and V–I characteristics of PEFC It has been known that CO molecules in the reformed gas adsorb on the electrode material (Pt) and selectively deactivate during PEFC operation. The electrode reaction in this fuel cell proceeds at the triple phase boundary of electrode–electrolyte–gas phase. Therefore, the anodic reaction is expected to directly affect the V–I characteristics and the cell performance. To elucidate the effect of the CO concentration, the V–I characteristics of PEFC were evaluated by feeding hydrogen mixed with various concentration levels of CO (Fig. 1 ). PEFC could be satisfactorily operated until a carbon monoxide level of 70ppm. Fuel cell performance was gradually deteriorated with a feed of the fuel CO concentration higher than 70ppm. The power generation characteristics of PEFC were significantly deteriorated with a carbon monoxide level of 100ppm. The V–I curve has been obtained by short-term evaluation of the cell. The allowable level of CO appears to be lower than the present case for long-term experiments. Hydrogen fuel for PEFC can be obtained with steam reforming process of methanol. Although Cu-based catalysts attain a high conversion of methanol reforming, the fuel after this reaction contains 1000ppm to a few percent of CO. The concentration increases with temperature due to the forward and backward shift of the equilibrium of Reactions (4) and (5), respectively. (4) CH 3 OH⇄CO+2H 2 (5) CO+H 2 O⇄CO 2+H 2 Therefore, it is difficult to remove CO at the operation temperature for steam reforming reaction. Water gas shift reaction (5) at low reaction temperature is one possible way for reduction of CO in the presence of a large amount of water to shift the equilibrium to the forward direction. 3.2 CO removal reaction in the presence of oxygen We have previously reported that the addition of O2 to the reformed fuel is effective to enhance the CO removal with an assistance of CO oxidation reaction (6) [23]. (6) CO+ 1 2 O 2→CO 2 The equilibrium composition of CO–CO2–H2–H2O–O2 can be estimated from the thermodynamic data and calculated CO and H2 conversions are shown in Fig. 2 [24]. In the O2 free condition, H2 conversion is slightly negative at low temperatures, since only shift reaction is operative at this condition. H2 conversion is slightly positive at high temperature due to reverse shift reaction to produce CO from CO2 and H2 (Reaction (5)). Although, hydrogen is oxidized by the presence of oxygen in the reformed fuel (Reaction (7)), CO oxidation proceeds and CO conversion increased with increasing concentration of oxygen. (7) H 2+ 1 2 O 2→H 2 O The slopes of the curves for the H2 conversion are quite gradual because of the excessive amount of H2 to CO. Cu catalysts supported on several mixed oxides (Cu/MO x –M′O y ) were investigated for CO removal reaction by oxygen-assisted WGSR of a model gas for post-reforming fuel. Figs. 3(a) and (b) summarize CO conversions over Cu catalysts supported on alumina-based mixed oxides (Cu/Al2O3–MO x ), and on zinc oxide-based mixed oxides (Cu/ZnO–MO x ), respectively. The CO conversion increased with a rise in reaction temperature in the low temperature region, whereas it decreased because of the thermodynamic limitation at high temperatures over every supported Cu catalyst. The activity only decreased with a rise in temperature for Cu/Al2O3–Cr2O3 at 150°C or higher temperatures. Cu/Al2O3–ZnO demonstrated an excellent activity among these catalysts, and Cu/Al2O3–Cr2O3 also demonstrated fairly good activity. The removal of CO proceeded effectively in the presence of a high concentration of H2 over both catalysts. Two Mn-containing catalysts had fairly good activities. The CO conversion over Cu/Al2O3–ZnO attained the equilibrium level at 250°C and decreased with an increase of temperature in accordance with the equilibrium conversion. The decrease in conversion was commonly observed for every catalyst at high temperatures. It has been generally known that some noble metal catalysts possess excellent activity for H2 and CO oxidation [14–17]. Therefore, 2wt.% M″–28wt.% Cu/Al2O3–ZnO (M″; noble metals) catalysts were prepared for promoting CO oxidation. Every noble metal-supported catalyst had lower activity than that of Cu/Al2O3–ZnO in Fig. 4 . Catalytic activity was significantly retarded by the presence of noble metals in Cu/Al2O3–ZnO. Neither CO oxidation nor shift reaction proceeded on these catalysts containing a noble metal. 3.3 Removal of CO over Cu/Al2O3–ZnO The effect of the calcination temperature on the catalytic activity was investigated. Figs. 5 and 6 show the X-ray diffraction patterns, BET surface areas and the CO conversion over Cu/Al2O3–ZnO after calcination at 500, 700 and 900°C. Copper and zinc spinel (CuAl2O4, ZnAl2O4), copper oxide (CuO) phases appeared at 700°C and the spinel phase grew after calcination at 900°C. The BET surface area of the catalysts decreased with a rise in calcination temperature. XRD measurements indicated that CuO was reduced into the metallic Cu state after H2 reduction at 400°C during reaction. The catalysts calcined at 500 and 700°C demonstrated excellent activities for CO removal at 150 and 200°C; then it attained equilibrium conversion at 250°C or higher temperatures. The catalytic activity slightly decreased when the calcination temperature was raised up to 700°C. The catalytic activity significantly deteriorated when the catalyst was treated at 900°C; thus, the CO conversion did not reach the equilibrium. The observation reveals that the catalytic activity also depends on the BET surface area and crystallinity of the oxide phases. The influence of oxygen concentration added to the reformed fuel on CO and H2 conversion was investigated for the catalysts calcined at 500 and 700°C. Fig. 7 shows CO and H2 conversion for oxygen concentration over the respective catalysts. The addition of a small amount of O2 greatly promoted CO removal, especially at 150°C. The CO conversion at 150°C finally became higher than that at 200°C in favor of the thermodynamic equilibrium. CO conversion was about 90% when CO conversion was constant. Further addition of O2 only led to H2 conversion without promoting CO removal. The activity for CO removal was investigated in a low space velocity condition. The longer contact time was effective in improving conversion (Fig. 8 ). The CO conversion was improved without increasing H2 conversion. These observations support the conclusion that catalytic removal of CO largely depends on space velocity. Since the CO removal approached the thermodynamic equilibrium at low space velocity, highly active catalysts are needed to achieve efficient removal of CO for the application to PEFC. 4 Conclusions The mixed oxide catalyst of Cu/Al2O3–ZnO exhibited the excellent activity for removal of a small amount of CO in reformed fuel from methanol with oxygen-assisted water gas shift reaction. The catalysts calcined at 500 or 700°C achieved 90% conversion for CO removal at the reaction temperature of 150°C in the presence of about 2% O2. Though further addition of oxygen to the reformed fuel only led to unselective oxidation of hydrogen, CO conversion was improved with a decrease in space velocity. The resultant CO conversion approached to the thermodynamic equilibrium. This reaction is effective in removing CO from methanol-originated fuel and in producing CO-free H2 or supporting a process to produce it.
