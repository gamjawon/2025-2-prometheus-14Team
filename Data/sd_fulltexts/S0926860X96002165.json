The near-surface reduction was clearly lower for the C02(CO)8 derived catalyst than for the C04(CO)12 based one. The hydrogen chemisorption, CO desorption, XRD and XPS measurements indicated that the dispersion of the metallic species decreased in the precursor order C02(CO)8 > C04(CO)12 >> Co(NO3)2. The TPD studies showed that CO was more strongly adsorbed on catalysts derived from carbonyls than on those based on nitrate, resulting in greater initial activity in CO hydrogenation. In pulsed CO hydrogenation reactions, the selectivity of the C02(CO)8 derived catalyst differed from the other two. Thus, despite the well documented transformation of the C02(CO)8 to C04(CO)12 on the silica support, the supported catalysts derived from these two precursors exhibited distinct characteristics and reactivity.

Introduction Cobalt catalysts have been studied extensively, owing to their high activity in synthesis gas reactions. The type of metal precursor employed in the impregna- tion of the support has a significant effect on the metal-support interactions, reduction properties and dispersion [1,2].

Niemeli~ et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 325-345 catalysts of carbonyl origin in CO hydrogenation has been found higher than that of the nitrate derived catalyst [3-9]. Some contend that the high activity of the carbonyl derived catalysts is related to the high dispersion [4,6], whereas others report that the specific activity of well-reduced cobalt catalysts is independent of the dispersion [8-10]. Even though the high activity of carbonyl based catalysts in CO hydrogena- tion has been well documented [3-9] the selectivities have been found either similar to [3,11] or different from [4,6] the conventional catalysts. Without promotion, the conventional supported cobalt catalysts have typically produced a mixture of hydrocarbons according to Schultz-Flory polymerization law [12], whilst some studies claim [4,6] that the carbonyl catalysts have been much more selective (20%) towards alcohols. However, alcohol formation has also been linked to unintentional promotion effects caused by impurities in the support matrix [13,14] -- a suggestion which cannot be ignored. In terms of the CO2 yields and olefin/paraffin ratios, the catalysts of carbonyl origin differ little from conventional catalysts [11], but the chain growth has been found to be both higher [11] and lower [15]. However, the chain length of the hydrocarbons is also related to the mean pore diameter of the support. The small metal particles generated inside the pores result in increased residence times of C m and heavier hydrocarbons, and these liquid hydrocarbons are hydrocracked to lighter prod- ucts [16,17]. In all, quite a number of detailed studies deal with cobalt catalysts on alumina [11,18-24] or silica [4,6,18,19,24-29] support. Some authors also discuss [30-33] the effect of the nature of the cobalt carbonyl precursor on the characteristics of the catalysts. Since the silica supported Co2(CO)8 readily decomposes to Co4(CO)12 under vacuum or thermal treatment [30-32] it is interesting that the initial activities of the catalysts have differed significantly in CO hydrogenation [33,34]. Therefore, we compare the conventional nitrate derived catalyst to the catalysts of carbonyl origin, as well as distinguish between the two different carbonyl precursors. We wish to elucidate the effect of the precursor on the extent of reduction, dispersion and reactivity on the silica support. 2. Experimental 2.1. Catalyst preparation The following abbreviations are used for precursors in conjunction with the catalyst: N for nitrates and CO for carbonyl compounds. The catalysts prepared from C02(CO)s and C04(CO)12 are designated 2-Co(CO)/SiO2 and 4- Co(CO)/SiO2, respectively. M.K. Niernelii et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 325-345 327 The preparation of the Co(N)/SiO2 catalyst by impregnation has been described in our previous publication [7]. In preparing the Co(CO)/SiO2 catalysts, Grace 432 silica was pretreated at 873 K under vacuum to dehydroxyl- ate the support [11,35]. This thermal treatment brings about partial dehydroxyla- tion, and the number of OH groups on the silica decreases to approx. 30% of the initial value [35]. The weakly acidic OH groups may act as adsorption sites for the carbonyl precursors [36]. The pretreated support was impregnated with carbonyl precursors from dichloromethane solution [37,38] under oxygen free conditions, and the excess solvent was removed under vacuum at room tempera- ture. In terms of pretreatment, the Co(N)//SiO2 catalyst was calcined under air flow at 573 K for 12 h. The Co(N)//SiO2 was reduced under hydrogen flow at 673 K for 7 h, and the Co(CO)/SiOz catalysts were decarbonylated under hydrogen flow at 573 K for 2 h. The temperatures for reduction were chosen based on the present TPR results and previous experimental procedures [7,38]. The cobalt contents of the catalysts were determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) after dissolving of the samples in a mixture of hydrochloric, nitric and hydrofluoric acid. The cobalt contents were 4.9 wt.-% for Co(N)/SiO2, 4.6 wt.-% for 2-Co(CO)/SiO2 and 4.7 wt.-% for 2-Co(CO)/SiO2. The crystal size of the catalysts was determined by X-ray diffraction using a Phillips MPD 1880 equipped with a Cu K~ radiator. The mean crystalline diameters were calculated by the Sherrer equation [39]. The XRD results were not corrected for the instrumental broadening of the experimentally measured profile [40]. Prior to the XRD measurements, the Co(N)/SiO2 catalyst was calcined. The Co(CO)/SiO2 catalysts were decarbonylated (H2, 573 K, 2 h), and oxidized in ambient conditions during sample transfer, because the measure- ments could not be performed under oxygen free conditions. Consequently, the XRD lines were too diffuse to allow particle size determinations. The upper limit estimates for the crystalline size were, however, determined after oxidizing the Co(CO)/SiO2 samples in air at 573 K for 2 h, which treatment may induce particle size growth [26]. XPS analysis was used to determine the extent of cobalt reduction. The reduced catalyst samples were supported on aluminium sample holders with a thin film of low vapour pressure resin and transferred under nitrogen to XPS analysis. The XPS apparatus was a Perkin-Elmer model 3057 PC-controlled ESCA labsystem, with a dual-anode X-ray source operating in UHV. A1Ka X-rays and a hemispherical analyzer operating at the constant pass energy of 50 eV were used. The Si 2p binding energy of 103.7 eV was used as an energy reference to take into account the charging of the insulating SiO2 samples [41]. The peak area of the metallic component of the Co 2p3/2 photoelectron peak was determined from a Gauss-Lorenzian peak fit [42], in combination with a Shirley-type [43] or a linear background correction algorithm. The ratio of this peak area to the total area of Co 2p3/2 was used as a measure of the extent of 328 M.K. Niemelii et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 325-345 cobalt reduction. This method gives a lower limit for the extent of reduction since only the outermost cobalt layers can be seen by XPS, and also because energy losses could not be resolved from the real chemical shifts. The disper- sions were estimated according to the Kerkhof-Moulijn-type method described by Le6n [44]. The inelastic mean free paths (IMFP) needed in the dispersion estimates were interpolated from the tabulated values given by Tanuma et al. [45]. The BET-surface area and the pore size distribution of the support, as well as dispersions of the catalysts were determined by static hydrogen chemisorption measurements using an Omnisorp 100CX. Prior to measurements the catalysts were reduced. The standard experimental procedure [46,47] was utilized, and the results were based on total hydrogen uptake at 303 K, because the amount of irreversible adsorption was sensitive to both the duration of the evacuation and the amount of sample. The dispersions and the estimates of particle size assuming spherical geometry of uniform size were corrected with the extent of reduction determined by XPS. 2.2. Temperature programmed techniques The temperature programmed and pulse reaction studies were carried out using a down flow tubular quartz microreactor connected to a Balzers GAM 415 quadrupole mass spectrometer. In the temperature programmed reduction (TPR) studies, a sample (300 mg) of impregnated (Co(CO)/SiO2) or calcined (Co(N)/SiO2) catalyst was placed in a flow of 3% H2 in Ar (Hz-Ar). The temperature of the Co(CO)/SiO2 and Co(N)/SiO2 catalysts was ramped at a linear rate of 3 K/min from 298 K to 723 K and from 298 K to 1123 K, respectively. The products formed during the reduction were detected by the mass spectrometer. For the desorption and reactivity studies, the Co(CO)/SiO2 catalyst samples of 300 mg were reduced, whereas the respective amount of the Co(N)/SiO2 catalyst was first calcined and then reduced. After reduction, the catalyst samples were cooled and flushed with He. The CO adsorption capacity of the samples was determined by pulsing CO under an inert gas carrier. To saturate the catalyst surface, 10 pulses were given at 298 K. The species adsorbed on the surface were removed during subsequent TPD. The catalysts were cooled to room temperature, after which the catalyst surface was reacted with H 2-Ar and the temperature elevated from 298 K to 673 K to remove any carbonaceous residues formed on the surface (TPSR). The catalyst sample was cooled to 298 K before evaluating the initial reactivity as described hereafter. The initial reactivity of the catalysts was evaluated at 298 K and 523 K by commencing CO pulses under a H2-Ar carrier. The catalysts were subjected to l0 pulses of CO at 298 K and the reaction products were detected. The species adsorbed on the catalysts were removed by elevating the temperature from 298 M.K. Niemelii et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 325-345 329 K to 673 K under He flow. Thereafter, the catalyst was subjected to CO pulses at 523 K under H2-Ar flow, the reaction products were detected and the TPD was carried out from 523 K to 673 K. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Characterization of the catalysts The reducibility of the catalysts was studied by TPR. The reduction of the Co(N)/SiO2 was determined by the consumption of hydrogen. The other species followed were oxygen, the decomposition products of the nitrate ion and water (see Fig. 1). Trace amounts of oxygen, retained on the Co(N)/SiO2 catalyst, reacted with hydrogen to form water below 423 K. Some reductive decomposition of the nitrate ion (mass number 30) was observed at approx. 473 K, i.e. at a lower temperature than reported (523 K) by Rosynek and Polanski le-03 0.00250 le-04 le-05 ~ le-06 le-07 le-08 ....

Two peaks of hydrogen consumption were observed at approx. 473-623 K, consistent with the reduction of Co304 --* CoO ~ Coo [25], but significant consumption of hydrogen and formation of water still occurred at approx. 673-1073 K. Castner et al. [25] have reported that the first step of the reduction of Co/SiO2 occurred near 573 K, and the second step of the reduction depended on the ease of removing the H20 produced during the CoO ~ Coo step, i.e. on the size of the pores of the silica support [25]. In case of large pore silica (14 nm), the reduction was complete according to TPR and XAS/TPR results by 673-823 K, whereas the reduction of small pore silica (3 nm) was completed by 923-1123 K. Thus, our results seem reasonable, since 85% of the silica pores are 5-10 nm, 9% 4-5 nm and the remaining 5% 3-4 nm in radius. The products detected during the TPR of the Co(CO)/SiO2 catalysts were CO, water, methane and CO2, see Figs. 2 and 3. All of these, as well as C2 hydrocarbons, have also been observed by Hucul [48] for Co2(CO)8 and M.K.

On both of the carbonyl based catalysts, the formation of the products mainly took place below 573 K. The decomposition of the carbonyl precursors was evident from the evolution of CO, with the maximum peak at 408 K. The hydrogen consumption of 2- Co(CO)/SiO2 during the reduction was similar to that of 4-Co(CO)/SiO2, indicating a similar decarbonylation pattern in accordance with the known transformation of Co2(CO)8 to Co4(CO)~2 in contact with silica in vacuo [31,49]. The hydrogen consumption below approx. 423 K may be associated with the first stage of methane and water formation due to dissociation of CO on the metallic cobalt sites [50,51] since the oxygen species were detected simulta- neously with methane. Further consumption of hydrogen took place in two stages; first moderately at 393-423 K and then to a greater degree at 423-523 K. The first peak we assign to the formation of water, and the second one to the 332 M.K. Niemelii et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 325-345 formation of water and hydrogenation of the carbonaceous residues on the catalyst surface reacting to methane. Also, the formation of carbon dioxide increased considerably after 423 K, reaching a maximum at approx. 473 K. It is noteworthy that the 2-Co(CO)/SiO2 catalyst appeared to have more of the reactive carbonaceous residues, since at temperatures above 523 K the amount of methane and carbon dioxide detected remained higher and that of hydrogen lower than on 4-Co(CO)/SiO2. The higher amount of carbonaceous residues might be due to accumulation of carbon during the solvent evaporation step of the catalyst preparation, i.e. as a result of partial decomposition of the precursor. According to Guczi et al. [52] and Schay et al. [53] the carbonaceous residues on the surface of the Fe-Rh/Cab-O-Sil catalyst functioned as a dispersion aid during thermal decomposition of the carbonyl under a helium atmosphere. Therefore we might expect higher dispersion for 2-Co(CO)/SiO2 than for 4-Co(CO)/SiO2. The XP spectra shown in Fig. 4 were measured to estimate the extent of reduction of the catalysts by calculating the ratio of the peak area of the metallic component to the total area of the Co 2P3/2 photoelectron peak [42] after linear background subtraction. This method should give a rather acceptable estimate of the amount of reduced cobalt for Co(CO)/SiO2, because the crystalline size according to XRD (Table 1) is of the same order of magnitude as the inelastic photoelectron mean free paths. This assumption may not, however, be valid for the Co(N)/SiO2 catalyst with the large particle size [54], since the intensity of the XPS peaks is related to the dispersion of the supported phase [54-57]. Yet, the effect of particle dispersion on the extent of reduction cannot be approxi- mated from the present XPS data since the Kerkhof-Moulijn type model [44] gives the C-parameters larger than unity implying cobalt deposition in the external area of the silica grains and/or monodispersion. Furthermore, for the Co(N)/SiO2 catalyst the assumption of homogeneous distribution of cobalt particles within the silica matrix is not valid, since the migration of cobalt species during calcination has been shown to occur [7,26]. The evaluation of the background in the XPS data also influences the results considerably. The Shirley background correction method [43] produced a signifi- cantly higher extent of reduction than did the linear correction. For example, Shirley background correction resulted in a 63% extent of reduction for Co(N)/SiO2, whereas linear correction gave a value of 42%. Correspondingly, for 2-Co(CO)/SiOz the respective values were 32% and 15%, and for 4- Co(CO)/SiO2 they were 66% and 41%. Therefore, the two background subtrac- tion methods were compared to the Tougaard method [58] on another cobalt catalyst sample. Unfortunately, the Tougaard method could not be used in this data set due to a too narrow energy range recorded. The linear subtraction method gave approximately the right slope for the inelastic background under the Co 2P3/2 peak. In case of the Shirley method the background was much too high at the high binding energy side of the Co 2P3/2 structure thereby enhancing M.K.

Thus, linear background correction appeared more appropriate out of the two available. This interpretation of the XPS data indicated that 41% and 15% of the cobalt species were metallic on the near surface layer of 4-Co(CO)/SiO2 and 2- Table 1 The characteristics of the Co/SiO2 catalysts after reduction by hydrogen Catalyst on SiO2 H2 uptake (/xmol/gcat) Dispersion (%) Reduction (%) Size (nm) Size (nm) XPS chemisorption XRD Co(N) 12.5 7.1 42 13 14 2-Co(CO) 46.2 80 15 1.2 2.3 a 4-Co(CO) 52.2 32 41 3.0 3.4 a a Upper limit estimate only, since the sample was oxidized at 573 K prior to measurement. 334 M.K. Niemel~ et al./ Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 325-345 Co(CO)/SiO2, respectively. For example, Johnson et al. [11] and Fu and Bartholomew [20] have supported Co4(C0)12 on dehydroxylated alumina by solvent reflux. After reduction with hydrogen at 623 K, the extent of reduction determined by oxygen titration [59] was 28% for 4 wt.-% Co/AI203 [11] and 62% for 3 wt.-% Co/AI203 [20]. Considering that cobalt catalysts supported on alumina have consistently exhibited lower extents of reduction than those supported on silica [18], the 41% near-surface reduction we found for 4- Co(CO)/SiO2 is lOW. Moreover, the value obtained for 2-Co(CO)/SiO2 (15%) was certainly low, particularly considering the similarity of the TPR results for the two carbonyl based catalysts. The 42% extent of reduction obtained for Co(N)/SiO2 also appears low in the light of the previous data [18,19,25]. The low values may in part be due to differences in the methods of determination, i.e. oxygen titration [18,19] versus surface sensitive XPS. However, it is also possible that the extents of reduction for the silica supported cobalt catalysts were limited by the formation of nonreducible cobalt silicates -- the species observed in conjunction with water impregnation, drying and calcination as well as high dispersion [10,27-29]. The chemisorption data reported in Table 1 showed that the hydrogen uptake of the two Co(CO)/SiO2 catalysts was similar, which is in agreement with the results obtained by Hucul [48] for Co2(CO)8 and Co4(CO)12 supported on alumina. Thus, the dispersion corrected with the extent of reduction for 2- Co(CO)/SiO2 was 80%, whereas that for 4-Co(CO)/SiO2 was 32%. Hence, the carbonaceous residues might have improved the dispersion in case of 2- Co(CO)/SiO2 [52,53]. The dispersions of the catalysts are high compared to the values of 20% and 34% obtained by Fu and Bartholomew [20] and Johnson et al. [11], respectively, for Co4(C0)12 supported on dehydroxylated alumina. The high values of dispersion are, however, a natural outcome of the very low extents of reduction estimated according to XPS. It is also noteworthy that the dispersion of 4-Co(CO)/SiO2 catalyst was clearly higher than the dispersion of Co(N)/SiO2 at the same level of the near-surface reduction. 3.2. Pulse reactions 3.2.1. CO adsorption During the CO pulsing at 298 K the adsorption was not strong for Co(N)/SiO2, i.e. all the pulses were of the same size, see Fig. 5. In case of both 2-Co(CO)/SiO2 and 4-Co(CO)/SiO2 the adsorption of CO was seen during the very first pulse (0.5 cm3), see Figs. 6 and 7, since the first pulse was smaller in area than the consecutive pulses. However, the difference was much less for 4-Co(CO)/SiO2 than for 2-Co(CO)/SiO2 although their hydrogen uptakes were similar. Nevertheless, the catalysts of carbonyl origin appeared to adsorb more CO than did Co(N)/SiO2. The results depicted in Figs. 5-7 also show that hydrogen, methane and CO2 *n,U M.K.

Although small peaks of hydrogen were detected as a background signal for CO pulses, it is likely that hydrogen retained on the surface was replaced by CO, the CO was dissociated [50], and the surface carbon thus formed reacted to produce CO2 or methane. It is also noteworthy that the amounts of CH4 formed were similar on all catalysts, whereas the amount of CO2 formed was lowest on the 2-Co(CO)/SiO2 catalyst.

The 2-Co(CO)/SiO2 catalyst, with the highest dispersion and lowest near-surface reduction, desorbed hydrogen, CO, CO2 and methane, but no water. In other words, the desorption of hydrogen was accompanied by the formation of water on Co(N)/SiO2 and 4-Co(CO)/SiO2, and by the formation of methane on 2-Co(CO)/SiO2. The amount of CO2 desorption was, however, similar for all catalysts although it ceased at a considerably lower temperature on Co(N)/SiO2; only a small amount of CO2 was detected above 523 K. The differences in the desorption of CO were significant meriting a more detailed analysis. M.K.

CO desorption during the TPD subsequent to CO pulsing for all catalysts. the decomposition of carbonaceous residues retained on the surface during the reduction, whereas for 4-Co(CO)/SiO2 the peak above 573 K could be due to adsorbed CO. The results depicted in Table 2 indicate that the amount of CO desorption during the TPD decreased in the order 2-Co(CO)/SiO2 > 4-Co(CO)/SiO2 > Co(N)/SiO2 (see also Fig. 8), although the hydrogen uptake of 2-Co(CO)/SiO2 was similar to that of 4-Co(CO)/SiO2. Thus, due to the higher dispersion, more CO molecules adsorbed per surface cobalt atom on 2-Co(CO)/SiO2 than on 4-Co(CO)/SiO2. In fact, the subcarbonyl adsorption forms are found to be prevalent on well-dispersed cobalt catalysts [18]. Hence, the CO adsorption was directly related to dispersion. The peak synthesis also indicated that the carbonyl based catalysts exhibited different types of adsorption sites than did Co(N)/SiO2, since a good fit required four peaks instead of three. In case of the two carbonyls, the presence of at least four types of active sites appeared more prominent for 2-Co(CO)/SiO2 with the highest dispersion. Also, the desorption occurred at higher temperatures for Co(CO)/SiO2 than for Co(N)/SiO2. According to Fu and Bartholomew [20], CO adsorbs more strongly on sites active for CO hydrogenation. The M.K.

The resulting desorption mass spectra of Co(N)/SiO2 and 4-Co(CO)/SiO2 were surprisingly similar; both catalysts desorbed water, CO, CO2 and a small amount of hydrogen at approximately the same tempera- tures. Clearly less water was desorbed from 2-Co(CO)/SiO2 than from 4- Co(CO)/SiO2, and methane was also desorbed from 2-Co(CO)/SiO2 above 498 K. Thus, the TPD results after reaction at 298 K are similar to the TPD results after CO pulsing thereby confirming the different characteristics of the surface of 2-Co(CO)/SiO2 compared to 4-Co(CO)/SiO2. le-02 le-03 - le-04 N le-05- le-06 - le-07 le-08 ' I * I ' I ~ I ' I ' I ' I ' I ~ I ' I ' 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 Time, s iii~iiiiiil H2 ......

At 523 K, the Co(N)/SiO2 and 4-Co(CO)/SiO2 catalysts behaved fairly similarly during the reactivity experiment; both produced methane, ethane and CO2 as well as a small amount of water. Also, the hydrogen consumption occurred in two stages and was of the same order, see Figs. 10 and !1. In relation to the other two catalysts, 2-Co(CO)/SiO2 converted the pulsed CO very quickly producing more methane, much less ethane, a similar amount of CO2, and no water, while clearly consuming more hydrogen, see Fig. 12. Thus, the initial activity was directly related to the strength of CO adsorption. In 342 M.K.

Initial reactivity of 2-Co(CO)/SiO2 at 523 K. agreement with our results, Meyers and Hall [33] have detected that the initial activity of the alumina supported Co2(CO)8 was higher than that of Co4(CO)12. In terms of selectivities, Ferkul et al. [32] have noted that the water yields were exceptionally low and the CO2 yields high for both silica supported Co2(CO)8 and Co4(CO)12. Their experimental set-up was, however, very different from ours, and they did not [28] give any details regarding the crystallite size or reduction rendering further discussion impossible. The different selectivity of the 2-Co(CO)/SiO2 merits a more detailed discussion. First of all, 2-Co(CO)/SiOz evidently dissociates CO generating M.K. Niemeli~ et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 325-345 343 reactive surface species of oxygen and carbon. Our results indicate that the oxygen species do not react to form water, and the formation of CO2 cannot entirely explain the consumption of these oxygen species. We can conclude that the oxygen containing species formed through dissociative chemisorption most likely reacted to form other products; oxygenates, for example. Accordingly, our previous study indicated that alcohol formation was higher on 2-Co(CO)/SiO2 than on Co(N)/SiO2 [7]. The connection between the formation of C2+- oxygenates and high dispersion has been reported previously [4,6]. The 2- Co(CO)/SiO2 catalyst exhibited the highest dispersion, thereby providing active sites advantageous for the formation of oxygenates. Also, Ponec [12] has suggested that the formation of oxygenated compounds is enhanced on the positively charged, transition metal-oxide promoted, active sites which are present on the poorly reduced 2-Co(CO)/SiO2 rather than on the more metallic 4-Co(CO)/SiO2. The source of minute amounts of promoters for our catalysts could have been the support [7]. Furthermore, the low amount of ethane formation on 2-Co(CO)/SiO2 could also be related to high dispersion, i.e. to a lack of adjacent sites large enough to accommodate CHx species. In support to this explanation, the probability of chain growth was slightly lower for 2-Co(CO)/SiO2 than for Co(N)/SiO2 in steady-state CO hydrogenation [7]. 4. Summary and conclusions This study was carried out to obtain insights into the effect of the precursor, in particular on the effect of the nature of the cobalt carbonyl precursor, on the dispersion and the reactivity of the active sites of cobalt catalysts on a silica support. The catalysts were characterized by AAS, XRD, XPS, TPR and TPD, and their initial reactivity was evaluated in a pulse micro reactor. The 2-Co(CO) precursor was transformed to 4-Co(CO) during the vacuum drying step of the catalyst preparation sequence. Due to this partial decarbonyla- tion, the surface of the 2-Co(CO)/SiO2 catalyst contained more carbonaceous residues functioning as a dispersion aid, and resulting in distinct characteristics for the two carbonyl catalysts. Namely, even though the TPR results indicated a similar reducibility pattern for the two carbonyl catalysts, the near-surface reduction (XPS) was clearly lower for the 2-Co(CO) precursor than for 4- Co(CO). As a result of similar, but clearly higher hydrogen uptakes than for Co(N)/SiO2, and different near-surface reducibilities, the dispersion decreased in the precursor order 2-Co(CO)> 4-Co(CO)>> Co(N). In accordance, the amount of CO adsorbed/desorbed decreased in the same order. The TPD studies also showed that CO was more strongly adsorbed on the carbonyl derived (2-Co(CO)> 4-Co(CO)) catalysts than on Co(N)/SiO2, and the stronger adsorption was associated with greater initial activity in CO 344 M.K. Niemelii et al. /Applied Catalysis A: General 147 (1996) 325-345 hydrogenation. In pulsed reaction, the selectivity of 2-Co(CO)/SiO2, which had the highest dispersion and lowest near-surface reduction, differed from the other two: more methane, less ethane and no water were detected. Since the dispersion of both carbonyl based catalysts was considerably higher than that of the conventional one, the product distribution cannot be related to the particle size alone, but must be closely related to the extent of reduction. Therefore, we suggest that the oxygen species on 2-Co(CO)/SiO2 reacted in part to form oxygenated compounds supporting the formation of oxygenates on the well dispersed partially reduced active sites. Thus, despite the well documented transformation of 2-Co(CO) to 4-Co(CO) on the silica support, the supported catalysts derived from these two precursors exhibited distinct characteristics and reactivity due to different dispersion and extent of reduction.

The effect of the precursor on the characteristics of the Co/SiO2 catalysts prepared from Co(NO3)2, Co2(CO)8 and Co4(CO)12 was determined. The near-surface reduction was clearly lower for the Co2(CO)8 derived catalyst than for the Co4(CO)12 based one. The hydrogen chemisorption, CO desorption, XRD and XPS measurements indicated that the dispersion of the metallic species decreased in the precursor order Co2(CO)8 > Co4(CO)12 ≫ Co(NO3)2. The TPD studies showed that CO was more strongly adsorbed on catalysts derived from carbonyls than on those based on nitrate, resulting in greater initial activity in CO hydrogenation. In pulsed CO hydrogenation reactions, the selectivity of the Co2(CO)8 derived catalyst differed from the other two. Thus, despite the well documented transformation of the Co2(CO)8 to Co4(CO)12 on the silica support, the supported catalysts derived from these two precursors exhibited distinct characteristics and reactivity.

        "dc:description": "The effect of the precursor on the characteristics of the Co/SiO2 catalysts prepared from Co(NO3)2, Co2(CO)8 and Co4(CO)12 was determined. The near-surface reduction was clearly lower for the Co2(CO)8 derived catalyst than for the Co4(CO)12 based one. The hydrogen chemisorption, CO desorption, XRD and XPS measurements indicated that the dispersion of the metallic species decreased in the precursor order Co2(CO)8 > Co4(CO)12 ≫ Co(NO3)2. The TPD studies showed that CO was more strongly adsorbed on catalysts derived from carbonyls than on those based on nitrate, resulting in greater initial activity in CO hydrogenation. In pulsed CO hydrogenation reactions, the selectivity of the Co2(CO)8 derived catalyst differed from the other two. Thus, despite the well documented transformation of the Co2(CO)8 to Co4(CO)12 on the silica support, the supported catalysts derived from these two precursors exhibited distinct characteristics and reactivity.",
