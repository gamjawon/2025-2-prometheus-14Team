Herein, Pd/CeO2 catalysts were prepared using different Pd precursors and applied to CH4 and CO oxidation. Significantly, the Pd/CeO2 catalyst prepared using palladium nitrate (Pd(2)/CeO2 (N)) was highly active toward CH4 oxidation, whereas the catalyst prepared using palladium acetate (Pd(2)/CeO2 (A)) exhibited high CO oxidation activity. The effects of the precursor on the catalytic activity and other properties were studied using various characterization techniques. The Pd(2)/CeO2 (N) catalyst contained surface PdO nanoparticles, which were active sites for CH4 oxidation. On the contrary, the Pd(2)/CeO2 (A) catalyst possessed Pd ions stabilized at CeO2 defect sites, which were not very reactive. However, the high Pd dispersion was beneficial for the CO oxidation reaction. Therefore, the Pd precursor clearly altered the Pd dispersion and state in the Pd/CeO2, which are critical for catalytic activity.

However, toxic gasses, including nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, and carbon monoxide, are emitted from internal combustion engines, which can seriously impact the environment [1]. Among the available technologies, catalytic oxidation is considered the most effective for reducing hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions [2]. Thus, developing highly active catalysts for CH4 and CO oxidation reactions is essential to meet stringent regulations implemented to promote clean environments. Noble metal catalysts, especially those containing Pd, have attracted significant attention due to the excellent catalytic activities for various oxidation reactions [3–6]. Because of their high cost, noble metal catalysts are generally prepared by dispersing a small amount of the precious metal on a support material, such as alumina, ceria, or zeolite [7–9]. Among them, ceria is generally utilized for oxidation reactions owing to the redox properties arising from the Ce4+/Ce3+ cycle, strong interaction with supported metals and large oxygen storage capacity [10–13]. Because of the limited availability of noble metals, the synthesis of highly active catalysts with low metal loadings is essential for industrial applications. Pd species in Pd/CeO2 catalysts can exist in various states, most commonly as metallic Pd, PdO nanoparticles, and highly dispersed Pd ions stabilized in ceria defect sites by forming a PdxCe1-xO2-δ solid solution [14,15]. Each Pd phases exhibits different catalytic activities for different reactions. Therefore, understanding the active phase of Pd for a specific reaction is important to synthesize a highly active catalyst with an appropriate Pd state. It is widely reported that the state of Pd in Pd/CeO2 catalysts can be adjusted by various methods. First, the Pd state can be altered by the morphology of ceria support [15–17]. Chen et al. and Hu et al. studied methane, propane and CO oxidation activities of Pd/CeO2 catalysts prepared using ceria supports with octahedron, cube, and rod morphologies [15,17]. The catalyst prepared using a ceria support with octahedral morphology was more active toward methane and propane oxidation compared to the rod morphology catalyst because PdOx nanoparticles on the former cracked CH bonds more efficiently than the highly dispersed Pd ions on the latter. On the other hand, the rod morphology catalyst was more active toward CO oxidation because the Pd ions in PdxCe1-xO2-δ solid solution easily created oxygen vacancy sites. In addition, the preparation method is another critical factor for altering the Pd phase in Pd/CeO2 [18–21]. Ma et al. investigated CH4 combustion over Pd/CeO2 synthesized by different methods [18]. The ratio of PdO particles to PdxCe1-xO2-δ was affected by the preparation method, and catalytic activity was correlated to the surface PdO concentration. Liu et al. also investigated the effects of Pd state on the propane oxidation activity of Pd/CeO2 by modifying preparation method [21]. They claimed that PdO was more favorable for propane activation and oxidative decomposition of reaction intermediates compared to the solid solution. Compared to the numerous studies on the ceria morphology and preparation method, the role of Pd precursors on the properties and activities of Pd/CeO2 remains largely unexplored to the best of our knowledge. Danielis et al. explored the effects of Pd salt in Pd/CeO2 prepared by dry milling method, but their work was more focused on tuning the oxidation state of Pd by altering the calcination condition [22]. Monteiro et al. investigated CO oxidation over Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/CeO2/Al2O3 catalysts prepared by different precursors [23]. They revealed that the Pd dispersion was affected by the precursor type, but the chemical state of Pd species was not discussed in detail. Herein, the Pd/CeO2 catalysts prepared using different Pd precursors (palladium nitrate and acetate) were applied to the catalytic oxidation of CH4 and CO. After combining results from various characterization techniques, it was revealed that the type of Pd precursor clearly affected the state and dispersion of Pd species, which were critical factors for the catalytic activity. 2 Methods 2.1 Preparation of catalyst Commercial CeO2 (Rhodia), palladium nitrate dihydrate (Sigma-Aldrich), and palladium acetate (Sigma-Aldrich) were utilized to prepare Pd/CeO2 catalysts containing 2 wt% Pd (incipient impregnation method). After the impregnation, the catalysts were dried (80 °C for 16 h) and subsequently thermally treated under static air condition (500 °C for 2 h). The samples prepared using palladium nitrate and acetate are designated as Pd(2)/CeO2 (N) and Pd(2)/CeO2 (A), respectively. 2.2 Catalyst characterization Microstructural characterization using high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was carried out on a JEM-ARM200F (JEOL) with a spherical aberration corrector (200 kV). CO chemisorption was conducted on a BEL-CAT-II (BEL Japan) system. The samples were reduced under 5% H2/Ar at 300 °C for 30 min before the analysis. After lowering the temperature to −78 °C, pulsed-CO chemisorption was performed. The dispersion of metallic Pd, D (%), was computed from the following equation: D ( % ) = V × S F × M W V m o l × W × 100 , where V is the volume of adsorbed CO; SF is the stoichiometric factor (Pd/CO = 2); MW is the Pd molar mass; Vmol is the standard molar volume of CO, and W is the supported Pd weight [24]. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out on a SmartLab (Rigaku) system (30 mA, 40 kV). Raman spectroscopy experiment was operated on a DXR2xi (Thermo Fischer Scientific) system with the samples excited at 532 nm. H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was operated on a BEL-CAT-II system. Before the analysis, the samples were pretreated with 50 mL/min Ar at 300 °C. After lowering the temperature to −80 °C, it was raised to 600 ° with 30 mL/min of 5% H2 balanced with Ar (10 °C/min). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was operated on a K-alpha spectrometer (Thermo Fischer Scientific). The C 1 s reference peak (284.6 eV) was utilized to correct the binding energies. Bulk Pd loading was calculated via inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) using an OPTIMA 8300 (Perkin-Elmer) apparatus. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) data were obtained from the 7D-XAFS beamline of the Pohang Light Source (PLS-II) at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data were acquired from the raw data using the Athena program (Demeter) for data processing. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the uncalcined Pd(2)/CeO2 (A) sample was conducted using a Discovery TGA (TA Instruments) apparatus. The temperature was heated to 500 °C under air or N2 (5 °C/min). 2.3 Catalytic reaction system CH4 combustion was operated in a quartz reactor. The catalysts were mixed with SiO2 beads to disperse heat generated from the reaction. The feed was consisted of 1000 ppm CH4 and 15% O2 (N2 balance) and flowed into the reactor (60,000 mL/gcat·h). In addition, 5% H2O was included to the feed for the investigation of H2O effects. The outlet feed gas composition was analyzed via online gas chromatography (Younglin 6500) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and flame ionization detector (FID). The CH4 conversion was determined after 30 min stabilization in the range of 250 to 450 °C at 25 °C intervals. Similar to the CH4 combustion reaction, CO oxidation was also operated in a quartz reactor. The catalysts were reduced at 400 °C for 30 min before the reaction (10% H2 balanced with N2). The reactant feed was comprised of 1% CO and 10% O2 (N2 balance) and flowed into the reactor (400,000 mL/gcat·h). After 1 h of stabilization at 40 °C, the temperature was increased by 2 °C/min from 40 to 160 °C. The outlet feed gas composition was examined using a Nicolet iS50 Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer (Thermo Fischer Scientific). The turnover frequency (TOF) was determined from the equation: TOF ( s − 1 ) = C * X N * D ( s − 1 ) , where c is the moles of methane or CO in the reactant; X is the methane or CO conversion; N is the total amount of Pd (mole), and D is the Pd dispersion. 3 Results 3.1 Catalytic activity The Pd/CeO2 catalysts prepared using different Pd precursors were applied to the CH4 and CO oxidation reactions. The light-off curves for methane combustion are displayed in Fig. 1 . T50 values, the temperatures required for achieving 50% of CH4 conversion are in Table 1 . Both Fig. 1a and Table 1 illustrate that the activity of the Pd(2)/CeO2 (N) was superior to that of Pd(2)/CeO2 (A). Specifically, the T50 of the Pd(2)/CeO2 (N) was 318 °C, 75 °C lower than that of its counterpart. In addition, it should be considered that the exhaust of natural gas engines usually contains high water vapor concentrations. It is well-known that the CH4 oxidation activity is hindered by H2O owing to the accumulation of hydroxyl species, thereby reducing the number of active sites and hindering oxygen exchange between the Pd and support [7,25]. Therefore, the methane combustion reaction was also evaluated using a reactant containing 5% H2O (Fig. 1b). Compared to the dry conditions, the catalytic activities of both catalysts decreased after H2O addition, and the T50 increased by 50–60 °C. Nevertheless, the activity of the Pd(2)/CeO2 (N) remained superior to that of its counterpart under both conditions. CO oxidation was also carried out with the Pd/CeO2, as displayed in Fig. 2 . Reduction process was conducted at 400 °C before the reaction because it has been reported that Pd metal is more active toward CO oxidation than PdO [26]. Contrary to the CH4 oxidation results, the activity of Pd(2)/CeO2 (A) was superior to that of Pd(2)/CeO2 (N). Specifically, the T50 of the Pd(2)/CeO2 (A) was 107 °C, 22 °C lower than that of its counterpart. The effect of H2O on the catalyzed CO oxidation is displayed in Fig. 2b. Significantly, the catalytic performance was enhanced after H2O addition. Wang et al. described that the reaction of CO with hydroxyl can yield a carboxyl intermediate, decreasing the activation energy barrier by activating molecular O2 [27]. However, the Pd(2)/CeO2 (A) exhibited superior activity under both conditions. Therefore, it can be summarized that Pd/CeO2 catalytic activity was altered by the type of Pd precursor used, with opposite trends in catalytic activity for the reactions studied herein. The Pd precursor effects on the catalytic activity and properties was studied using subsequent characterization techniques. 3.2 Catalyst characterization The metal size distribution in the catalysts is generally analyzed using TEM images. However, it was hard to differentiate the Pd and ceria supports from the TEM images because the atomic numbers (Z-contrast) are similar [28]. Therefore, the elemental distribution in the Pd/CeO2 catalysts was analyzed via STEM-EDX mapping (Fig. 3 ). The Pd species agglomerated in an oval shape in the Pd(2)/CeO2 (N), indicating that the PdO nanoparticles were present on the ceria surface. In contrast, the Pd signal was very weak in the Pd(2)/CeO2 (A) catalyst, which indicates the highly dispersed Pd species throughout the ceria. In summary, EDX mapping clearly demonstrated that the size distribution of Pd metal is affected by the Pd precursor type. To further clarify the STEM-EDX mapping results, Pd metal dispersion was examined after the CO chemisorption experiment. For accurate measurements, CO should only be adsorbed on metallic Pd, but the literature suggests that CO can also adsorb on the CeO2 support at room temperature. Therefore, CO chemisorption was performed at −78 °C because CO cannot chemisorb on CeO2 at such low temperatures [29]. The Pd metal dispersion of the Pd(2)/CeO2 (N) and Pd(2)/CeO2 (A) were 18.8 and 52.6%, respectively (Table 2 ). Assuming that the metals on the surface are spherical, the average metal size was determined using the following equation: d P d ( n m ) = 112.1 D ( % ) , where D (%) is the dispersion of metal [24]. The average sizes of the metallic Pd in the Pd(2)/CeO2 (N) and Pd(2)/CeO2 (A) were 2.1 and 5.9 nm, respectively. Therefore, both STEM and CO chemisorption results confirmed the higher Pd dispersion in the Pd(2)/CeO2 (A), while large PdO particles were produced at the Pd(2)/CeO2 (N) surface. The XRD patterns of the samples exhibited a typical cubic fluorite phase of CeO2 (Fig. S1) [30]. As the catalysts were calcined under static air, it was expected that peaks corresponding to PdO would be observed for both catalysts. However, it is challenging to detect the characteristic diffraction peaks of PdO because the characteristic PdO peak (33.8°) overlaps with a large peak arising from the ceria support (33.2°) [31]. Because it was difficult to detect the PdO peak from the XRD analysis, the crystallinity of the PdO phase was analyzed using Raman spectroscopy. Fig. 4 displays that the peaks at 247 and 461 cm−1 arise from the CeO2 support, which are the second-order transverse acoustic (2TA) and fluorite F2g mode, respectively [20]. A new peak is found at 642 cm−1 only for the Pd(2)/CeO2 (N), which arises from the Pd-O bond stretching in the PdO4 structure often found at the core of crystalline nanoparticles [32]. Therefore, it was confirmed that the Pd(2)/CeO2 (N) contained a large amount of crystalline PdO nanoparticles, which agrees well with the EDX mapping and CO chemisorption results. H2-TPR experiments were conducted to investigate catalyst reducibility. Fig. 5 shows two reduction peaks for both catalysts, where the low-temperature peak at <100 °C is referred to PdO reduction and another peak at 400 °C to the surface CeO2 reduction [33–35]. The PdO reduction temperature was 54 °C for the Pd(2)/CeO2 (N), which was 45 °C lower than that for its counterpart. Stronger metal-support interactions generally increase the reduction temperature of the metal oxide [36]. Hence, it can be inferred that the metal-support interaction was stronger in the Pd(2)/CeO2 (A). Furthermore, the sharp reduction peak of the Pd(2)/CeO2 (N) indicates a rapid reduction process, further confirming that the metal-support interaction was weaker than in its counterpart [37]. Meanwhile, the H2 consumptions of the Pd(2)/CeO2 (N) and Pd(2)/CeO2 (A) samples were 0.41 and 0.49 mmol/g, respectively, both larger than the value required for the PdO reduction (0.19 mmol/g). This additional hydrogen consumption can be ascribed to the surface CeO2 reduction near the Pd species, which was likely facilitated by hydrogen spillover from palladium to the ceria [38]. The Pd state on the catalyst surface was examined by XPS analysis. Pd 3d spectra presents two peaks at 336.5 eV, arising from Pd2+ in PdO nanoparticles, and 337.7 eV, from Pdn+ (2 ≤ n ≤ 4) in the PdxCe1-xO2-δ solid solution (Fig. 6 ) [8,15,39]. The peak corresponding to Pd metal (335 eV) was not observed because the catalysts were thermally treated under normal atmospheric conditions. The quantitative data calculated from the XPS spectra confirm that the Pd state is altered by the precursor type (Table 3 ). Clearly, the PdO nanoparticles were major species in the Pd(2)/CeO2 (N), while the Pd species of the Pd(2)/CeO2 (A) were inserted into the defect sites of the CeO2 support and induced the formation of PdxCe1-xO2-δ. In addition, the peak intensity was higher for the Pd(2)/CeO2 (N) catalyst. Since XPS analysis is surface-sensitive, it can be interpreted that the PdO particles were exposed on the Pd(2)/CeO2 (N) surface, while the Pd species of the Pd(2)/CeO2 (A) sample were stabilized within the bulk ceria lattice. The surface atomic concentrations computed from the XPS data are displayed in Table 4 . Notably, the surface concentration of Pd was higher for the Pd(2)/CeO2 (N) catalyst, even though both catalysts were prepared with the same Pd loading (2 wt%), as confirmed via ICP-AES. Hence, the difference between the surface and bulk Pd concentrations can be explained by the chemical state. As previously discussed, Pd species exist at the ceria surface as PdOx nanoparticles in the Pd(2)/CeO2 (N). In contrast, the Pd species are located in the bulk CeO2 lattice as a PdxCe1-xO2-δ in the Pd(2)/CeO2 (A) sample. The Pd states were further examined by XAFS analysis. The XANES and EXAFS profiles are displayed in Fig. 7 a and 7b, respectively. The absorption edge profiles of both catalysts are close to that of the PdO reference (Fig. 7a). However, more detailed analyses of the XANES profiles highlight that the white line intensity of the Pd(2)/CeO2 (A) was slightly higher than that of the PdO reference. The increment of the white line intensity is caused by the increased Pd oxidation state [40]. This can be ascribed to the Pdn+ species in the Pd(2)/CeO2 (A), which is previously confirmed from the XPS analysis. The EXAFS profiles displays a peak at 1.5 Å arising from the first Pd-O coordination shell was detected from both catalysts, confirming that Pd was oxidized (Fig. 7b) [41,42]. Another peak at 2.9 Å was assigned to second shell Pd-O-Pd coordination [41,42] and the relative intensity of this peak was lower for the Pd(2)/CeO2 (A) catalyst compared with its counterpart. These results indicate that the Pd size was smaller for the Pd(2)/CeO2 (A) sample than for its counterpart, which is in agreement with the STEM-EDX mapping and CO chemisorption results. 4 Discussion Herein, Pd/CeO2 catalysts were prepared using different Pd precursors and applied to CH4 and CO oxidation reactions to examine their differing catalytic activities. The Pd(2)/CeO2 (N) catalyst was highly active for CH4 oxidation, whereas the Pd(2)/CeO2 (A) catalyst exhibited high CO oxidation activity. Therefore, it can be interpreted that catalytic performance is largely affected by the type of Pd precursor. The effects of the Pd precursor on the catalytic properties and activities were studied using various characterization techniques. Fig. S2 shows images of the Pd(2)/CeO2 samples, wherein it is clear that the color of the Pd(2)/CeO2 (N) catalyst is brown, whereas the Pd(2)/CeO2 (A) catalyst is dark yellow, closer to the ceria support color. From these results, it is plausible to assume that the Pd state differed between the two catalysts. Despite some discrepancies in literature regarding the identification of the active Pd states for methane oxidation, many authors have reported that PdO is the active state [15,43]. Chen et al. claimed that PdO can dissociate methane and fully oxidize to CO2, whereas the highly dispersed Pd ions are inactive in producing CO and tend to generate carbonate and formate species [15]. In addition, they claimed that the incomplete coordination of Pd2+ and adjacent oxygen atoms were responsible for the high activity of PdO. Thus, the difference in the methane oxidation activity can be explained by the difference in the Pd state, which was discussed in the previous catalyst characterization section. The STEM-EDX mapping images revealed the presence of PdO nanoparticles on the Pd(2)/CeO2 (N) surface, although it was difficult to observe them in the Pd(2)/CeO2 (A). From the Raman and XPS spectra, it can be inferred that a PdxCe1-xO2-δ was produced, and Pd species were highly dispersed in the ceria support defect sites. Therefore, it can be hypothesized that the Pd state is critical for determining the methane oxidation catalytic activity. For Pd(2)/CeO2 (A), Pdn+ stabilized in the bulk ceria lattice could not easily facilitate methane oxidation. In contrast, the PdO nanoparticles exposed on the Pd(2)/CeO2 (N) surface acted as active sites for methane oxidation. The CH4 oxidation over Pd/CeO2 proceeds via Mars-van Krevelen mechanism [18,43,44]. Accordingly, oxygen vacancies are produced when CH4 reacts with PdO. The oxygen vacancies are replenished by lattice oxygen diffusion from the ceria and adsorption of gas-phase O2. Therefore, methane oxidation activity can be affected by the oxygen vacancy replenishment rate. The PdxCe1-xO2-δ can act as a transition layer for oxygen species from the ceria to Pd [18]. Therefore, the inferior activity of the Pd(2)/CeO2 (A) sample than that of its counterpart can be explained by excess PdxCe1-xO2-δ because the transition channel thickness may limit the oxygen diffusion rate. However, the trend of activity was opposite for the CO oxidation. The Pd(2)/CeO2 (A) exhibited superior activity than the Pd/CeO2 in previous studies prepared by similar method (Table S1) [45–47]. In contrast to CH4 oxidation, the Pd/CeO2 samples were reduced prior to the reaction because metallic Pd has been reported to be more active for the reaction. Therefore, the difference in the CO oxidation activity between the catalysts cannot be explained using the Pd oxidation state. STEM-EDX, CO chemisorption, and EXAFS analyses revealed that the average Pd size was smaller in the Pd(2)/CeO2 (A) sample compared to that of its counterpart. The Pd species were introduced into the bulk ceria lattice, forming strong Pd-O-Ce bonds in the acetate catalyst. Therefore, the metal-support interaction was stronger than that in the Pd(2)/CeO2 (N) catalyst, as confirmed via the H2-TPR experiment. The strong metal-support interaction may explain the presence of highly dispersed Pd species because the Pd is stabilized by the support, and Pd agglomeration is prevented during reduction [36]. Therefore, the high activity of the Pd(2)/CeO2 (A) can be ascribed to high Pd dispersion that provided additional sites for CO adsorption. Although the light-off curves showed that the Pd(2)/CeO2 (A) catalyst exhibited superior activity than its counterpart, comparing catalytic activities in terms of TOF may be more appropriate because the number of active sites differs for catalysts with varying particle sizes. Fig. 8 a shows the CO oxidation activity in terms of TOF values. The catalytic activity data in the kinetically controlled regime (under 20% CO conversion) was used to improve accuracy [48]. The TOFs were similar in the kinetically controlled region (from 40 to 70 °C), although the Pd dispersion was different. In addition, the activation energy was obtained from the Arrhenius plot (Fig. 8b). The activation energies were within the range of the experimental error (44–48 kJ/mol). These results indicate that the catalytic active sites and reaction pathway are identical for both catalysts, irrespective of Pd dispersion. Therefore, the reaction is structure-insensitive reaction, as reported from previous research [49,50]. From the kinetic study, it can be concluded that the catalytic activity normalized by the catalyst weight was higher for Pd(2)/CeO2 (A) than that of its counterpart because of the larger number of active sites, whereas the activities normalized by the number of active sites were similar. Fig. 8c displays the Arrhenius plots of the catalysts for CH4 oxidation. In contrast to CO oxidation, the activation energy of Pd(2)/CeO2 (N) (73 kJ/mol) was significantly smaller than that of its counterpart. Because the active site for the methane oxidation reaction is known as PdO, the PdO nanoparticles on the Pd(2)/CeO2 (N) surface were more active in cleaving the methane CH bond than the Pd ions stabilized in the ceria lattice [15]. The major difference between Pd nitrate and acetate lies in their decomposition behavior. Pd nitrate directly decomposes to PdO, whereas Pd acetate initially decomposes to Pd metal and slowly oxidizes to PdO under oxidative conditions [22]. To investigate the decomposition behavior of Pd acetate impregnated on the ceria support, H2-TPR and TGA analyses were conducted on the Pd(2)/CeO2 (A) catalysts. Fig. S3a displays the H2-TPR results of Pd(2)/CeO2 (A) calcined under different conditions. As discussed previously, a reduction peak at 99 °C was detected from the Pd(2)/CeO2 (A) catalysts calcined in air, corresponding to Pd reduction. However, a reduction peak was not detected from −100 to 300 °C for the Pd(2)/CeO2 (A) sample calcined under N2, which implies the presence of metallic Pd on the catalyst. Therefore, the decomposition behavior of Pd acetate remained unchanged even after impregnation. Fig. S3b shows the TGA profiles of the Pd(2)/CeO2 (A) catalyst under air and N2 conditions. Notably, similar TGA profiles were obtained under both conditions, implying that the Pd species were inserted into the ceria lattice to form a PdxCe1-xO2-δ. This is because if Pd metal was oxidized to PdO, weight increases would be observed during the TGA process. Therefore, it can be concluded that Pd nitrate is more effective for synthesizing catalysts with PdO nanoparticles exposed on the ceria support surface. In contrast, Pd acetate impregnated on ceria decomposed into Pd metal, and subsequent calcination induced the incorporation of Pd species into the defect sites of ceria to form a Pd-O-Ce structure. It was induced by the interaction between the highly dispersed metallic Pd and ceria, which was higher than the interaction between the agglomerated PdO nanoparticles and ceria [51]. In conclusion, the Pd(2)/CeO2 (N) catalyst was highly active for CH4 combustion because the PdO nanoparticles exposed at the surface acted as active sites. In contrast, the Pd(2)/CeO2 (A) catalyst was more active for the CO oxidation reaction because the highly dispersed Pd provided additional sites for CO adsorption. 5 Conclusion Herein, the effects of the Pd precursor on the activities and properties of Pd/CeO2 catalysts were examined. Raman and XPS spectra disclosed that the Pd state was altered by the precursor type. The PdO nanoparticles exposed at the surface were active for CH4 combustion, which were more abundant on the Pd(2)/CeO2 (N) catalyst compared to that on its counterpart. However, most Pd species in the Pd(2)/CeO2 (A) existed as Pd ions stabilized in the ceria defect sites, which were not very active for the reaction. In addition, Pd dispersion was confirmed to be affected by the precursor type. The STEM-EDX mapping images, CO chemisorption, and EXAFS spectra revealed that the size of Pd was smaller in the Pd(2)/CeO2 (A) catalyst than that in its counterpart. The stronger metal-support interaction arising from the Pd-O-Ce bond of the PdxCe1-xO2-δ structure was the underlying cause of the high dispersion. Because of its high Pd dispersion, a large amount of CO was adsorbed on the Pd(2)/CeO2 (A) sample, which promoted the CO oxidation. In conclusion, the chemical state and dispersion status of Pd were largely affected by the Pd precursor and these proved to be critical for CH4 and CO oxidation activities.

        "dc:description": "Herein, Pd/CeO2 catalysts were prepared using different Pd precursors and applied to CH4 and CO oxidation. Significantly, the Pd/CeO2 catalyst prepared using palladium nitrate (Pd(2)/CeO2 (N)) was highly active toward CH4 oxidation, whereas the catalyst prepared using palladium acetate (Pd(2)/CeO2 (A)) exhibited high CO oxidation activity. The effects of the precursor on the catalytic activity and other properties were studied using various characterization techniques. The Pd(2)/CeO2 (N) catalyst contained surface PdO nanoparticles, which were active sites for CH4 oxidation. On the contrary, the Pd(2)/CeO2 (A) catalyst possessed Pd ions stabilized at CeO2 defect sites, which were not very reactive. However, the high Pd dispersion was beneficial for the CO oxidation reaction. Therefore, the Pd precursor clearly altered the Pd dispersion and state in the Pd/CeO2, which are critical for catalytic activity.",
