Bhattacharya, S. Sharma, A.P. Singh * Catalysis Division, National Chemical Laboratory, Pane-411008, India Received 20 February 1996; revised 19 July 1996; accepted 25 July 1996 Abstract The liquid phase benzoylation of naphthalene over various zeolites has been investigated in the temperature range 333-358 K using benzoyl chloride (BOC) as the benzoylating agent. H-beta catalyzes the reaction efficiently and selectively to 2-benzoylnaphthalene (2-BON) and is found to be superior to the other zeolite catalysts and A1C13. The conversion of benzoyl chloride to the products largely depends upon the reaction conditions and acidity of the zeolite catalysts. The acidity of the zeolite was measured by temperature programmed desorption of ammonia. It was observed that the conversion of BOC increased with the increase in time on stream, catalyst to BOC (wt./wt.) ratio, naphthalene to BOC molar ratio and reaction temperature. Under the reaction conditions (1 atm, 358 K, H-beta to BOC (wt./wt.) = 0.37, naphthalene to BOC (molar ratio) = 2. 17.6 wt.-% conversion of BOC and a selectivity for 2-BON of 74.8 wt.-% were obtained. Benzoic anhydride and benzoic acid were also used in the reaction. The catalyst, H-beta, was recycled four times and a slight decrease in BOC conversion was observed after each cycle which was related to the minor dealumination of zeolite catalyst by HC1 (formed during reaction). The formation of benzoylnaphthalenes is explained by an electrophilic attack of the benzoyl cation (C6H5CO+) on the naphthalene ring whose formation is facilitated by the stronger acid sites of the zeolite catalysts. Keywords: Benzoylation of naphthalene; Benzoylation over zeolite H-beta; 2-benzoylnaphthalene 1. Introduction Benzoyl naphthalenes are used as synthetic intermediates for the production of dyes [1].

Despite their considerable use, these catalysts are less effective in introducing directly a benzoyl group in high selectivity on the less reactive 2-position of naphthalene. In addition, homogeneous catalysts have several disadvantages: difficulty in catalyst recovery and use of stoichiometric amounts of the catalyst with respect to the benzoylating agent. Due to their shape selectivity, thermostability, the easy separation from the products and the possibility of regeneration of the deactivated catalysts, zeolite catalysts have been widely used in the field of petrochemistry [6,7]. However, their use in fine organic syntheses has been limited. Recently, zeolite catalysts were found to be active in the acylation of aromatics [8-15], however, there is no report to date on the benzoylation of polynuclear aromatics. In this paper, we disclose a new catalytic method for the selective benzoylation of naphthalene to 2-benzoylnaphthalene using zeolite H-beta as the catalyst and benzoylchloride as the benzoylating agent (Scheme 1). The optimum reaction conditions for the production of 2-benzoylnaphthalene are also examined in this study. The results obtained over zeolite catalysts are compared with the conventional catalyst, A1C13. 2. Experimental Zeolites ZSM-5. ZSM-12 and beta were synthesized following the procedure described in the literature [16-18]. These zeolites were calcined at 823 K in an air stream. The resultant samples were thrice NH~--exchanged using the follow- ing conditions: NH4NO3 = 1 M, 10 ml (NHaNO3)/g zeolite, 353 K, 6 h exchange run, pH 7-8 and calcined at 823 K for 8 h to get the protonic form. Na-Y was obtained from Laporte lnorganics, Chesire, UK. The preparation of the H-Y samples were carried out by thermal decomposition of NH4-Y zeolite following the experimental details described above. The H-REY (42.2) and H-RE-Y (70.6) samples were prepared by known procedures [15]. The crys- tallinity and phase purity of the zeolites were characterized by X-ray diffraction using CuK a radiation. The average particle sizes of the zeolites were deter- mined using Shimadzu (Model UV-2101 PC) scanning electron microscope. The surface area of the zeolites was measured by nitrogen BET method using an D.

Bhattacharya et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 150 (1997) 53-62 Onmisorb 100CX apparatus. The Si/AI ratio and cation composition of the samples were analyzed by a combination of wet chemical and atomic absorption spectroscopy (Hitachi 800). The properties of the catalysts are listed in Table 1. Before the reaction, the zeolite samples were dehydrated at 473 K under N2 for 6h. Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) measurements were carried out to measure the acid strength of the zeolite catalysts using ammonia as an adsorbate (Table 1) [15,19,20]. In a typical run, a 1.0 g portion of a calcined sample was placed in a quartz tubular reactor and heated at 773 K under a nitrogen flow of 50 ml/min for 4 h. The reactor was then cooled to 303 K and adsorption conducted at that temperature by exposing the sample to ammonia for 30 rain. Physically adsorbed ammonia was removed by purging the sample with a nitrogen stream flowing at 50 ml/min for 15 h at 303 K. Acid strength distribution was obtained by raising the catalyst temperature (10/min) from 303 K to 773 K in a number of steps in a flow of nitrogen (10 ml/min). The NH3 evolved was trapped in a HC1 solution and titrated with a standard NaOH solution. A typical reaction was carried out in a small flask. A mixture of catalyst (1 g), naphthalene (0.039 mol), benzoyl chloride (0.02 mol), and 1,2-dichloro- ethane (15 g) was stirred at the required temperature for 18 h. The courses of the reaction were followed by gas chromatograph (Blue Star Model 421) fitted with flame ionization detector and a capillary column (50 m 0.2 mm) with methyl silicone gum. Some selected runs were analyzed by GC-MS (Shimadzu-MS QP-2000A). The composition of the reaction mixture was determined by comparing their gas chromatographs with those of the authentic samples. The errors in the experimental results were found to be in the range of + 2-3%. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Various catalysts Reaction of the naphthalene with benzoyl chloride in 1,2-dichloroethane in the presence of various zeolites and conventional catalyst, A1CI3, affords variable mixtures of 1-benzoylnaphthalene (1-BON) and 2-benzoylnaphthalene (2-BON). Similar products have been reported in the literature when naphtha- lene was benzoylated with benzoic acid in the presence of polyphosphoric acid [3]. The results are summarized in Table 2. As is evident from the Table 2, zeolite H-beta is found to be the most active and selective catalyst in the conversion of benzoyl chloride and formation of 2-BON. In addition, the initial rate of BOC conversion is found to be higher (0.36 mmol g- 1 h- 1) over zeolite H-beta among the zeolites studied. H-RE-Y samples exhibited the very low D.

The inactivity of H-ZSM-5 (pore size = 5.6 X 5.4 ,~) and H-ZSM-12 (pore size = 6.0 X 5.7 A) may be attributed to their small pore openings han the size of the products (dimensions of 1-BON = 7.25 X 7.25 X 9.50 A and 2-BON = 6.25 X 6.25 X 11.0 A, dimen- sions of the 1-BON and 2-BON were calculated using Quanta software package distributed by Molecular Simulation Inc. USA). While H-Y and amorphous SiO2-A1203 are inactive due to their weaker acid sites [15]. The conversion of benzoylchloride over H-RE-Y (42.2), H-RE-Y (70.6), H-beta and A1C13 are found to be 1.2, 7.2, 17.6 and 14.6 wt.-%, respectively. The corresponding product ratios of 2-BON/1-BON are 0.23, 0.33, 4.30 and 0.08, respectively. These results show that the Lewis acid catalyst, A1C13, does not possess shape-selectivity and naphthalene is attacked preferentially to yield higher amount of 1-BON because 1-position of naphthalene is more reactive than 2-position [21]. Presumably, the higher activity of H-beta may be attributed to its stronger acid sites (Table 1) and stacking faults in the structure [9,14,15]. The unexpected increase in the ratio of products (2-BON/1-BON= 4.30) over H-beta compared to A1C13 (2-BON/1-BON= 0.08) may be explained by postulating that the reaction occurs in the pores of the H-beta. Thus the steric hindrance against-diffusion of products may favor the formation of 2-BON. The results confirm that the product ratio (2-BON/1-BON) was influenced by the pore size of the zeolites. The probable mechanism involves the polarization of benzoyl chloride into electrophile (C6HsCO+) by acidic catalysts which attacks the naphthalene ring and leads to the formation of benzoylnaphthalenes [15,22,23]. The various parameters on the above reaction are discussed using H-beta in the following section. The catalyst was recycled four times and a marginal decline in the BOC conversion was observed after each recycle. The decline in BOC conversion may be related to the minor dealumination of the zeolite catalyst due to the hydrogen chloride (liberated during the reaction). 3.2. Effect of reaction time Fig. 1 compares the conversion of benzoyl chloride using the similar reaction conditions on H-beta, H-RE-Y (42.2), H-RE-Y (70.6) and A1C13 catalysts as a function of reaction time. H-beta showed a lower initial activity compared with A1C13 but after 11 h the conversion of BOC over H-beta was found to be higher than A1C13. On the other hand, the lower activity of A1C13 after 11 h compared to H-beta may be attributed to less than the stoichiometric amount of A1C13 (in relation to BOC) used in the reaction. The H-RE-Y (42.2) and H-RE-Y (70.6) were considerably less active than the H-beta due to their weaker acid sites (Table 1). Based on the conversion of BOC after 18 h of reaction time, the trend in activities for the catalysts studied was as follows: H-beta > A1C13 > H-RE-Y (70.6) > H-RE-Y (42.2). D.

Conversion of benzoyl chloride (BOC) versus reaction time over various catalysts. Reaction conditions: catalyst/BOC = 0.37 (wt./wt.), naphthalene/BOC = 2 (molar ratio), naphthalene = 0.039 mol, 1,2-dichloro- ethane = 15 g, reaction temperature = 358 K. 3.3. Effect of catalyst to BOC ratio The catalyst to BOC ratios are changed by keeping the constant concentration of BOC in the reaction mixture. When the catalyst to BOC ratio is increased from 0.07 to 0.27, the conversion of BOC increased from 6.3 to 17.5 wt.-%, respectively. Above this ratio the conversion of BOC leveled off. In addition, the concentration of unwanted products (others) decreases significantly with the increase in catalyst to BOC ratio from 0.07 to 0.18, however, the relative ratio of 2-BON/1-BON seems not to be influenced by the change in catalyst to BOC ratio. 3.4. Effect of naphthalene to BOC molar ratio The ratios were changed by keeping the amount of naphthalene constant. The increase in naphthalene/BOC ratio up to 5 apparently gave a linear rise in the BOC conversion and above this ratio the conversion of BOC labeled off. The selectivity for 2-BON and ratio of 2-BON/1-BON decreased with the increase in naphthalene/BOC ratio while a slight increase in the selectivity for 1-BON was observed. The interesting observation of this study is that the formation of dibenzoylnaphthalene (others) is not observed when the molar ratio of naphtha- lene/BOC is raised more than 5. The conversion of benzoylchloride at 1, 2, 5, 7 and 10 molar ratios of naphthalene to BOC was found to be 17.5, 17.5, 13.8, 8.4 60 D.

The corresponding product ratios (2-BON/1-BON) were 5.1, 4.3, 3.0, 1.9 and 2.0, respectively. The same molar ratio was claimed to be efficient for the benzoylation and benzylation of toluene using zeolite and FeC13 catalysts [15,24,25]. 3.5. Effect of reaction temperature The temperature dependency of this reaction is shown in Fig. 2. The conversion of BOC over zeolite H-beta increases steadily from 2.2 to 17.5 wt.-% as the temperature was raised from 333 K to 353 K. The product ratio (2-BON/1-BON = 4.3) remains nearly similar with the increase in reaction temperature which indicates that isomerization of 1-BON to 2-BON does not take place at our reaction conditions (358 K). These results are in close agreement with the reported data over A1C13 and polyphosphoric acid where isomerization of 1-BON to 2-BON was not favored at 343 K [3,4]. The present results suggest that the zeolite H-beta plays an important role in determining the 2-BON/1-BON ratio. The apparent activation energy over H-beta was found to be 105 + 0.2 kJ/mol. 3.6. Effect of benzoylating agent Benzoic anhydride and benzoic acid are also employed as benzoylating agents instead of benzoyl chloride. Benzoic anhydride is also capable of benzoylating D. Bhattacharya et al. / Applied Catalysis A.\" General 150 (1997) 53-62 61 naphthalene, however, the benzoylation with benzoic acid did not proceed under the reaction conditions. Thus, upon heating a mixture of 0.039 mol naphthalene at 358 K, 0.008 mol benzoic anhydride, 15 g 1,2-dichloroethane and 1 g H-beta for 18 h, benzoic anhydride was converted up to 13.5 wt.-% with a product ratio of 2-BON/1-BON = 4.2. 4. Conclusions It is demonstrated for the first time that the zeolite H-beta catalyzes the benzoylation of naphthalene with benzoyl chloride efficiently, which leads to the formation of 2-benzoylnaphthalene in high selectivity. Conventional homoge- neous catalyst, A1C13, does not possess shape selectivity and favors the forma- tion of 1-benzoylnaphthalene in high yields. At identical reaction conditions, the activity trend after 18 h of reaction time is H-beta > A1C13 > H-RE-Y (70.6) > H-RE-Y (42.2) and the selectivity trend to 2-BON/1-BON is H-beta > H-RE-Y (70.6) > H-RE-Y (42.2)> A1C13. H-ZSM-5 and H-ZSM-12 are not active due to narrow diameter of the pores whereas H-Y and amorphous SiO2-A1203 are inactive due to their weaker acid sites. It is concluded that the presence of strong Bronsted acid sites in the zeolite catalysts appears to be very important for the polarization of benzoyl chloride into an electrophile (C6HsCO+) which then attacks the naphthalene ring resulting in the formation of benzoylnaphthalenes. The higher yield of products can be achieved by increasing the values of the reaction parameters such as reaction time, catalyst to BOC (wt./wt.) ratio, naphthalene to BOC molar ratio and reaction temperature. Benzoic anhydride is also found to be effective in the benzoylation of naphthalene but benzoic acid failed to give any product. Recycling of the catalyst progressively decreases the BOC conversion to a little extent. Acknowledgements D.B and S.S thank UGC and CSIR, India, respectively for research fellow- ship.

Bhattacharya S. Sharma A.P. Singh ∗ Catalysis Division, National Chemical Laboratory, Pune-411008, India ∗ Corresponding author. Fax: (+91-212) 334761. The liquid phase benzoylation of naphthalene over various zeolites has been investigated in the temperature range 333–358 K using benzoyl chloride (BOC) as the benzoylating agent. H-beta catalyzes the reaction efficiently and selectively to 2-benzoylnaphthalene (2-BON) and is found to be superior to the other zeolite catalysts and AlCl3. The conversion of benzoyl chloride to the products largely depends upon the reaction conditions and acidity of the zeolite catalysts. The acidity of the zeolite was measured by temperature programmed desorption of ammonia. It was observed that the conversion of BOC increased with the increase in time on stream, catalyst to BOC ( wt. wt. ) ratio, naphthalene to BOC molar ratio and reaction temperature. Under the reaction conditions (1 atm, 358 K, H-beta to BOC (wt. wt.) = 0.37, naphthalene to BOC (molar ratio) = 2. 17.6 wt.−% conversion of BOC and a selectivity for 2-BON of 74.8 wt.−% were obtained. Benzoic anhydride and benzoic acid were also used in the reaction. The catalyst, H-beta, was recycled four times and a slight decrease in BOC conversion was observed after each cycle which was related to the minor dealumination of zeolite catalyst by HCl (formed during reaction). The formation of benzoylnaphthalenes is explained by an electrophilic attack of the benzoyl cation (C6H5CO+) on the naphthalene ring whose formatin is facilitated by the stronger acid sites of the zeolite catalysts.
