CSIR – Indian Institute of Petroleum Dehradun 248005 India Graphical abstract Mesoporous Ni/NiO catalyst was synthesized using an organosilane as a mesopore template. This is a simple and low-cost green method to synthesize mesoporous Ni/NiO catalyst for hydrogenation of glucose to sorbitol. The synthesized catalyst was characterized by N2 sorption, XRD, SEM, TEM, SQUID, and XPS techniques. The hydrogenation reactions were performed over the synthesized Ni/NiO catalyst in the temperature range of 100–150 °C and 50 bar pressure. The conversion of glucose was 95%, and sorbitol yield was 84 wt% best obtained at 130 °C. The turn over frequency calculated for glucose conversion over Ni/NiO is 0.20 s−1 at 130 °C. The kinetic study shows that glucose hydrogenation follows pseudo-first-order kinetic concerning glucose concentration. The activation energy calculated over the synthesized Ni/NiO catalyst was 16 kJ mol−1, 4 times lower than that over Raney nickel catalyst. Keywords Hydrogenation Ni/NiO catalyst Sorbitol Kinetics study Glucose Introduction Biomass-derived feedstocks have great potential as a substitute for fossil fuels to meet our growing energy needs and also for the production of value-added chemicals [1]. It is reported that more than 90% of the global annual plant biomass is not used by humans and it may be used for fuel or chemicals without competing with food industry [2]. Sorbitol is the polyol with the most widespread use in nutrition, cosmetics, medical and industrial applications [3]. It is used as a low-calorie sweetener and sugar substitute for diabetics, as a humectant in cosmetic and pharmaceutical products, in paper and tobacco and other applications. It is a valuable additive which is also used in food, medicine, and cosmetics, besides its utilization as an intermediary in the production of vitamin C [4,5]. Sorbitol, the hydrogenation product of glucose, may be catalytically converted into a mixture of glycerol, ethylene glycol, and 1,2-propanediol [5,6]. Initially, the electrochemical reduction of D-glucose to sorbitol was explored [6,7]. However, the electrochemical process did not prove to be commercially attractive. Commercially sugar alcohols are produced by catalytic hydrogenation of mono- and polysaccharides using Raney-type nickel catalysts [7]. Furthermore, fixed bed processes in the presence of Ni catalysts are known for the production of sorbitol from glucose [8]. The key focus of the present work is to develop newer, cheaper and more stable nickel-based catalysts for hydrogenation reactions. The order of activity for the hydrogenation of glucose is, Ru ˃ Ni ˃ Rh ˃ Pd, as reported in the literature [9]. Sucrose is a disaccharide that turns into glucose and fructose by hydrolysis, and the hydrogenation of the monosaccharides produces both sorbitol and mannitol [3,10]. Mannitol produced during reaction has also wide applications in the food industries, and is also used as sweetener and diabetics products [5,6,10]. The industrial production of sorbitol and mannitol comes from the catalytic hydrogenation of glucose. In recent years, Raney-type nickel and ruthenium catalysts are mainly applied in sorbitol production, especially Ru-based catalysts [10]. Hoffer et al. [7] studied the selective hydrogenation of glucose over Ru/C catalyst and reported 98% selectivity to sorbitol, which was comparable to Raney-type Ni catalyst [8]. Ruthenium-based catalysts have been found to replace nickel-based catalysts due to their high activity and selectivity [9,10], but is much more expensive than nickel-based catalysts, and requires to be supported on carbon. Amongst the transition metals, Ni would be the most promising catalyst for this reaction as the hydrogenation of glucose to sorbitol has been practically performed over Raney Ni catalyst [10,11]. Cellulose can be hydrolyzed into glucose and subsequently catalytically hydrogenated into sorbitol and mannitol [12,13]. Most catalysts for glucose hydrogenation are based on nickel as active metal. Historically, Raney nickel was preferred because of its economic price. Later, supported nickel catalysts were more frequently used because they are more active. However, supported Ni catalysts have the disadvantages of leaching and lower selectivity for sorbitol [14–16]. It is still unclear why some supported Ni catalysts are inactive and some specified Ni catalysts are active [16]. A mesoporous carbon supported Ni catalyst was reported to be active for the conversion of cellulose into sorbitol, but this catalyst deactivated within three reuses [16]. It was reported that at 92% conversion of cellulose, 50% yield of sorbitol was obtained over Ni catalyst supported on carbon nanofibers. Further study indicated that high Ni content and presence of Brønsted acid sites resulted in high yield of hexitols, and high cellulose conversion [17,18]. Zhang et al. reported that nickel phosphides supported on activated carbon and SiO2 were effective for conversion of cellulose to sorbitol, and about 48% yield of sorbitol was reached at complete conversion [19,20]. In this work, we report the hydrogenation of D-glucose to produce sorbitol, and its kinetic study over unsupported magnetically separable mesoporous Ni/NiO catalyst synthesized using an organosilane template. Experimental Materials D-Glucose (Dextrose) was purchased from Fisher Scientific. Octadecyl dimethyl (3-(trimethoxy-silyl) propyl) ammonium chloride (ODAC) (60 wt% in methanol) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich Chemicals. Nickel precursor [Ni(NO3).6H2O], ethanol, sodium hydroxide and hydrazine hydrate were purchased from Merck India. De-ionized water used was obtained from Hi-Media laboratories. Catalyst synthesis The catalyst was synthesized by chemical reduction method. A 6 g nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2.6H2O) was added in 1000 ml water in a beaker at 40 °C and continuously stirred for 2 h. 3 g of ODAC (octadecyl dimethyl 3-trimethoxy silyl propyl ammonium chloride) as a mesoporous template was added dropwise. The pH was maintained at 11.5 by adding NaOH solution. The temperature was maintained at 60 °C, while continuously stirring. Further, 30 ml hydrazine hydrate (1 M) and 50 ml sodium borohydride (1 M) were added as reducing agents, and the temperature was increased to 80 °C, along with stirring at 500 rpm for 2 h. The dual reducing agent was used for complete reduction of Ni precursor to Ni/NiO. The resulting solution changed its color from green to black. The resulting precipitate was filtered and then dried at 80 °C. This dried material was extracted for 2 h, in ethanol, at 80 °C, to remove organic moieties and template. The synthesized Ni/NiO catalyst was magnetic in nature. The molar ratio of Ni precursor and template was 3:1 which was optimized the composition to obtain a material with the highest surface area. Finally, the synthesized catalyst was calcined at 500 °C for 6 h. Sodium borohydride is used to reduce NiO to Ni(0), and Hydrazine hydrate was used for the nucleation of nickel nanoparticle. The use of hydrazine hydrate in aerobic conditions leads to the formation of nickel oxide nanoparticles [21,22]. The use of NaBH4 results in the formation of nearly amorphous particles. The use of two reducing agents is also reported earlier for better reduction of nickel precursor [21,22]. The sample was calcined at 500 °C to create crystallinity [22] and then was further reduced with hydrogen to maximize the Ni(0) state. The final mesoporous material was thermally stable and crystalline. Catalyst characterization Crystal structure of catalyst was characterized with X-ray diffractometer (XRD), using Cu Kα radiation (40 kV and 40 mA, Bruker). Surface morphology of catalyst was analyzed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) FEI Quanta 200 F instrument at an acceleration tension of 30 kV. The TEM images were obtained with an electron microscope (Hitachi H7100 instrument operated at 75 KV). The sample was prepared in ethanol by sonication for 5 min and drop-coated on a copper grid for analysis. BET surface and pore size of the catalyst was measured by N2 sorption isotherms at 77 K using Belsorb MAX (BEL, Japan). The catalyst was pre-treated at 300 °C for 4 h under vacuum before analysis. Inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) analysis (DRE, PS-3000UV, LEEMAN LABS, INC, USA) was used to determine the elemental composition of the catalyst. Surface study and oxidation states of the catalyst were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using AXIS Ultra DLD system from Kratos with monochromatic Al Kα radiation at 1486.6 eV as an X-ray source. The acidity of the catalyst was determined by ammonia TPD (chemisorbs 2720 Micromeritics) equipped with TCD detector. The temperature-programmed reduction with hydrogen (H2-TPR) was performed using micromeritics TPX 2720. The sample (50 mg) was pre-treated under He atmosphere at 400 °C for 60 min to remove water and other impurities and then cooled down to 40 °C. H2-TPR was started at a heating rate of 10 °C/min up to 1000 °C in the flow of 10% H2/He mixture (30 ml/min). The consumption of H2 was monitored with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The FTIR spectrum was recorded in-situ using a FTIR spectrometer (REMSPEC Technologies). The sample was first adsorbed with pyridine then physically adsorbed pyridine was removed by heating at 100 °C for 2 h. The spectrum was recorded in the frequency range of 1400–1600 cm−1 with 37 scans. The magnetization and magnetic susceptibility were carried out through Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) Magnetometer. The metal dispersion is measured by static equilibrium chemisorption of H2 at 350 °C using a constant volume high-vacuum apparatus, Belsorb MAX (BEL, Japan). NMR measurements were performed on a State-of-the-art Bruker Av III 500 spectrometer, operating at a 1H frequency of 500 MHz, and equipped with Triple resonance broad band inverse probe. Catalytic activity and product analysis Hydrogenation reaction of glucose was performed in a batch reactor (Parr Instrumental Co. USA) at different temperatures (100–150 °C). The hydrogen pressure was maintained at 50 bar during the experiments. The product samples were collected at different reaction time intervals. 50 mg of the synthesized catalyst, 25 ml of distilled water and 1.2 g of glucose were taken in the reactor. The total volume of the reactor was 50 ml. The obtained products were analyzed by HPLC Shimadzu (model CMB-20A), C-18 column (dimension 250 × 0.3 mm). The system was equipped with RI detector. Water was used as mobile phase and pump flow rate was maintained at 0.6 ml/min. Quantitative analysis of liquid products was done using HPLC calibration curves. Recycling experiments were carried by washing the catalyst with acetone several times. No leached Ni was detected in the liquid product. Results and discussion The powder XRD pattern of the calcined mesoporous Ni/NiO catalyst is shown in Fig. 1 . The sharp peaks in XRD pattern indicate the crystalline nature of the synthesized catalyst. The presence of both Ni and NiO is observed. Ni planes, (111), (200) (220) (at 2θ of 45°, 53°, 76° respectively), and NiO (111), (220) planes (at 2θ of 37°, 62° respectively), are observed in XRD pattern. The XRD pattern of uncalcined shows two peaks of Ni(111), (220) planes (at 2θ of 44°, 76° respectively) and two peaks of NiO(111), (200) (at 2θ of 37°, 62° respectively). The ratio of Ni(0)/NiO calculated from the ratio of intensities of XRD peaks before calcinations was 3:1, and after calcination the ratio decreased to 1:1. So The ratio of Ni(0)/NiO decreased with the calcination, but the material becomes crystalline, and Ni crystallite size remains 6 nm (Table S1). The XRD pattern of spent Ni/NiO catalyst shows low peak intensities. The Ni(111) crystallite size of spent Ni/NiO is calculated to be 5 nm, and the ratio of Ni/NiO is calculated to be 1:1 (Table S1). SEM (Fig. 2 a) shows the fibrous morphology of the materials. TEM (Fig. 2b) shows dark colored (10–20 nm) spherical Ni nanoparticles on grey sheet-like NiO. SAED (inset, Fig. 2) shows the crystalline nature of the catalyst system. The High-resolution TEM imaging of the used Ni/NiO catalyst showed the presence of 11–24 nm black colored spherical Ni particles (Fig. S1a). The lattice fringes with an interplanar distance of 0.20 nm were observed in HRTEM image (Fig. S1b). Clear lattice fringes of 0.20 nm were observed, which is in the fair agreement with the XRD, indicating that Ni/NiO is highly crystalline. The SAED patterns (Fig. S1c) of used Ni/NiO shows that catalyst is highly crystalline even after the reaction. The chemical composition of the spent Ni/NiO was also determined by elemental mapping and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis (Fig. S1d). EDAX analysis of spent Ni/NiO shows 42% Ni and 0.4% Si. N2 sorption isotherm and pore size distribution curve are shown in Fig. 3 . N2 sorption isotherm indicates type IV isotherm. BET surface area was 250 m2/g (highest reported) and pore volume was 0.24 cm3/g. Pore diameter was 4 nm, as measured from the desorption branch of the N2 isotherms, by the BJH method. This indicates that the material was mesoporous and has high surface area. The surface area of the uncalcined Ni/NiO was measured to be 160 m2/g with pore dimater 4 nm. After calcination followed by reduction, the surface area increased to 250 m2/g while the pore diameter remained 4 nm (Table S2). The surface area of Ni/NiO after reduction increased 1.5 times and pore volume also increased from 0.17 to 0.24 cm3/g. The surface area of spent catalyst was measured to be 100 m2/g after the reaction and but the pore diameter increased to 6 nm. The total acidity of the catalyst was determined by the NH3-TPD study (Fig. S2). Acidity for catalyst was 0.20 mmol/gcat, due to the presence of Brönsted and Lewis acid sites. TPD desorption peak obtained at 174 °C can be attributed to ammonia adsorbed on weak Lewis acid sites. The peak at 280–600 °C could be ascribed to strong adsorption of NH3 at strong acid sites (Brönsted sites). The pyridine FTIR spectrum was recorded for distinguishing different types of acid sites in Ni/NiO catalyst. The Ni/NiO catalyst showed two bands (Fig. S3) at 1580, and 1444 cm−1, attributed to aromatic CC vibrations from the ring of pyridine [23,24]. These bands are characteristic of the pyridinium ion, ascribed to the adsorption of pyridine molecules on Lewis-acid sites. The FTIR band at 1539 cm−1 is related with adsorption of pyridine on Brønsted acidic sites [28]. The acidity is mainly related to the hydrolysis rate and the selectivity for the sorbitol and mannitol in hydrogenation reaction [25]. The concept of “bifunctional catalyst” is widely accepted, and many favorable results are reported by a combination of active metal sites with solid acidic support. The study is also accompanied at low temperatures (150–200 °C), where the hydrolysis rate does not depend on the strength of the acidic sites [25]. The acidic sites supported the hydrogenation rate at certain lower temperatures (150–200 °C), resulting in lower hydrolysis rate [25,26]. ICP-AES analysis showed the elemental composition of the synthesized catalyst. It was found that the nickel content was 34 wt% and silica content was 1.7 wt%. ICP result of spent Ni/NiO shows that the active Ni species 45% is present after the reaction, so there is little possibility of Ni leaching during the reaction. The silicon content is 0.88% in spent catalyst. The fresh catalyst has about 34% Ni active metal species in the catalyst system. About 10% active metal Ni species has increased after the reaction. It may be attributed to the reduction of NiO to Ni species by hydrogen consumption during hydrogenation reaction. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis indicated that the material is a mixture of nickel oxide and metallic Ni. The Ni 2p3/2 XPS spectrum (Fig. 4 ) of the catalyst indicated the presence of Ni0 and Ni2+ states. Fig. 4 shows the two peaks of Ni2+, ascribed to Ni (2p3/2) and Ni (2p1/2), at binding energies of 854 and 872 eV, respectively. The two satellite peaks, Ni (2p3/2) at a binding energy of 861 and Ni (2p1/2) at 880 eV, for Ni2+ were also observed. The peaks at 853 eV and 872 eV ascribed to metallic Ni. The satellite peaks might have originated due to multiple splitting in the spin-orbit energy levels. The presence of peaks at 855 and 853 eV, respectively, corresponding to the Ni2+ and Ni0 oxidation states, confirmed presences of NiO and Ni on the surface of the catalyst. The dconvulated Ni 2p XPS spectrum shows that 44% nickel is present in zero-valent states, and 56% nickel is present in Ni+2.The deconvulated Ni 2p XPS data shows that the Ni/NiO ratio is 0.8/1 in fresh Ni/NiO catalyst. The Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) profiles of Ni/NiO and pure NiO catalysts are displayed in Fig. 5 . The pure NiO exhibited only a single reduction peak at temperatures around 400 °C, corresponding to the reduction of surface or bulk NiO to Ni. The H2-TPR patterns of the calcined and uncalcined Ni/NiO catalysts showed peaks at around 460 °C and 630 °C. Pure NiO shows broad hydrogen consumption with peak at 400 °C. Calcined Ni/NiO catalyst showed a very weak peak at 630 °C indicating that most of the Ni is reduced at lower temperature, in comparison to the uncalcined Ni/NiO. This indicates that calcinations has a positive effect in terms of lowering the reduction temperature of Ni/NiO catalyst after calcination. Magnetic nature of Ni/NiO catalyst was measured using Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) Magnetometer. The room temperature magnetic hysteresis loop (Fig. S4) shows that Ni/NiO have a saturation magnetization (Ms) of 0.7 emu g−1, coercivity Hc of 60 (Oe). The good magnetized life of Ni/NiO catalyst is shown with no hysteresis loss. This magnetic property ensures the easy separation of nickel catalyst from the reaction mixture by applying external magnetic field (100% magnetic recoverability). Catalytic hydrogenation of glucose Catalytic hydrogenation of glucose was performed over mesoporous Ni/NiO catalyst in an autoclave batch reactor at a temperature range of 100–150 °C and at a constant hydrogen pressure of 50 bar. The yields of sorbitol and mannitol were 80% and 10%, respectively, at 100 °C, with 90% glucose conversion (Table 1 ). Glucose conversion increased with the increase in temperature from 100 to 130 °C (Fig. 6 ). Further increase in the temperature (>150 °C) did not affect the glucose conversion and sorbitol yield. The yield of sorbitol increased from 78 wt% to 84 wt% by increasing the temperature from 100 to 130 °C. 1H NMR study shows the qualitative analysis for hydrogenation of glucose over Ni/NiO catalyst. The peak at 5 ppm corresponds to glucose concentration. At higher temperature, the peak intensity corresponds to glucose concentration was diminished (Fig. S5 and Fig. S6). Hydrogenation of glucose over Ni/NiO catalyst showed 95% glucose conversion and 89% selectivity to sorbitol product. The TOF was calculated by regulating the reaction rate by the number of surface active sites (metal dispersion). The catalyst showed 4% metal dispersion. The TOF at 100 °C for conversion of glucose over Ni/NiO catalyst was 0.15 s−1 and increased to 0.2 s−1 with the increase in temperature to 130 °C. TOF calculated was 1.5–2 times more than the TOF calculated for glucose hydrogenation reaction over Raney Ni catalyst (Table 1) in similar experimental conditions. The catalytic hydrogenation of conventional nickel supported on SiO2 showed 38% glucose conversion and the selectivity to sorbitol is 92% at 120 °C and 120 bar hydrogen pressure [15]. The more expensive ruthenium-based catalyst showed 70% glucose conversion and the 90% sorbitol selectivity at 120 °C and 120 bar hydrogen pressure [15]. Hydrogenation of glucose over Ni/NiO catalyst showed 95% glucose conversion and 89% selectivity to sorbitol product at lower temperature (100 °C) and lower hydrogen pressure (50 bar). Ni/NiO catalyst is acidic due to the presence of SiO2 which provides a suitable combination of acidity and hydrogenation on the surface of the catalyst for glucose conversion to sorbitol. Rate constant and activation energy calculation The kinetic study of glucose hydrogenation was performed at 100, 130, and 150 °C (Fig. 7 ). The rate constants and the activation energy were calculated for glucose hydrogenation reaction over mesoporous Ni/NiO catalyst. The concentration of glucose decreased linearly with reaction time (Fig. 6) indicating that glucose hydrogenation follows pseudo 1st order kinetics concerning glucose concentration, as also reported in the literature [27,28]. The rate constants were calculated at 100, 130 and 150 °C. The rate constants obtained was 0.13 h-1, 0.20 h-1 and 0.24 h-1, respectively. The graph of lnK vs 1/T (Fig. S7) was plotted including rate constant obtained at 100, 130 and 150 °C. The activation energy obtained was 16.4 kJ/mol from the slope of the graph (in Fig. S7). This could be attributed to the activity of the Raney-type catalysts which is mainly dependent on their specific surface area [28,29]. The obtained results demonstrate better conversion of glucose over the Ni/NiO catalyst than Raney nickel and other industrial Ni-based catalysts (Table 1). Recyclability of the Ni/NiO catalyst The fresh Ni/NiO shows 95% glucose conversion and 88% sorbitol selectivity. In the first recycle, conversion decreased slightly to 90% and remains constant in the second recycle. Little (2%) decrease in selectivity was observed on recycling. This indicated very slow deactivation of Ni/NiO catalyst during recycling. Leaching test showed the absence of Ni in the products after reaction from ICP analysis. Conclusion A high-surface area (250 m2/g), low cost and magnetically separable mesoporous Ni/NiO catalyst was synthesized by chemical reduction method. The catalyst showed high conversion and high selectivity for hydrogenation of glucose to sorbitol. The TOF for the conversion of glucose to sorbitol over Ni/NiO catalyst was 0.15–2 times higher than the TOF as reported over Raney nickel catalyst in similar reaction conditions. The reaction followed pseudo-first-order kinetic concerning glucose concentration. The activation energy was determined as 16 kJ/mol for Ni/NiO system which is 4-times lower than that for Raney nickel. This is due to acidity, high surface area, and more active sites present on the surface of the catalyst. The catalyst showed little deactivation in three runs.
