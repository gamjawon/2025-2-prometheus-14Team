Galvagno, G. Capannelli Universita di Messina, Dipartimento di Chimica Indvstriale, Cos. Post. 29, 1-98166 Sant' Agata (Messina) (Italy) G. Neri, A. Donato and R. Pietropaolo Universita di Reggio Calabria, Facolta di Ingegneria, Via Cwsssocrea 48, 1-89100 Reggio Calabria (Italy) (Received May 3, 1990; accepted August 22, 1990) Abstract Hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde has been carried out over Ru catalysts supported on activated carbon at 333 K and atmospheric pressure using ethanol as solvent. The activity and selectivity of Ru/C catalysts have been investigated in order to elucidate the effect of metal particle size on the hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes. The specific activity expressed per Ru surface atom remains constant with metal dispersion, indicating that the rate-determining step of the reaction is structure-insensitive. Selectivity to cinnamyi alcohol increases with Ru particle size, reaching a value of about 60% on the less dispersed samples. Introduction Hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes to the corresponding unsaturated alcohols is an important step in the preparation of various fine chemicals, and several attempts have been made to develop a suitable catalytic system [1-16]. While hydrogenation of the C=C double bond is readily achieved by most platinum metal catalysts under mild conditions [17], the selective reduction to unsaturated alcohols is a difficult task. Tuley and Adams have shown that platinum can become selective for the production of unsaturated alcohols upon addition of iron chloride [1]. The effect of additives on the catalytic properties of platinum has been recently confirmed [8, 9, 12, 13]. Over Pt Ge, a selectivity to unsaturated alcohol > 95% at total conversion has been obtained at atmospheric pressure and mild temperature [9]. It has been suggested that the effect of the additives is associated with the formation of new catalytic sites, involving possible promoter cations, which are able to coordinate the oxygen atom in the carbonyl group and to activate it. The general goal of the present work is to extend the results previously observed on platinum-promoted catalysts to other catalytic systems in order to verify: (a) the general validity of the proposed hypothesis; and (b) the 0304-5102/91/$3.50 Elsevler Sequoia/Printed In The Netherlands 238 possibility of substituting platinum with a less expensive metal. Within this general framework, in this paper we report a study on the catalytic performance of monometallic Ru catalysts supported on activated carbon for the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde. Literature data on the catalytic behaviour of ruthenium towards the selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes are rather scarce [11, 15, 18] and a systematic study on the effect of metal loading and metal particle size has never been previously reported. Experimental The catalysts used in this study were prepared by impregnation of activated carbon (Chemviron SCXII 80-100 mesh, surface area 900-1100 m2 g~1) with aqueous solutions of commercial hydrated ruthenium trichloride having an appropriate Ru concentration. The amount of solution used was slightly greater than the pore volume. After impregnation, the catalysts were dried at 393 K and stored in air. Before chemisorption and catalytic activity measurements Ru/C samples were reduced at 673 K under flowing Hg. Chemisorption of Og and CO were measured in a conventional pulse system operating at room temperature. Negligible amount of Og and CO were found to chemisorb on the support. Electron microscopy (TEM) studies were carried out on a Siemens Elmiscop 102 microscope. Microscopy specimens were prepared by placing the catalyst powder on perforated carbon film mounted on a copper grid. The specimens were then coated with carbon by using a Balzer Union sputtering device. Metal particle size distributions were obtained by counting several hundred particles. The catalytic activity of Ru/C samples was tested in the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde. Cinnamaldehyde (Fluka, purity > 98%) was distilled under vacuum before use. Hydrogenations were carried in a 100 ml four-necked flask fitted with a dropping funnel, a reflux condenser and a thermocouple. The catalyst was added to the required amount of solvent (25 ml of 95% ethanol), then treated for 1 h under Hg flow. After cooling at reaction temperature (333 K, unless otherwise specified), the organic substrate was injected through one arm of the flask. The reaction mixture was stirred with a stirrer head with permanent magnetic coupling (Medimex) at a rate of 500 rpm and the reaction was carried out at atmospheric pressure under Hz flow. The progress of the reaction was followed by analyzing a sufficient number of microsamples withdrawn from the reaction mixture. Chemical analysis was performed with a gas chromatograph (Carlo Erba model 4200) equipped with a flame ionization detector. The gas chromatographic column used was 10% GP over SP2100. Quantitative analysis was carried out by calculating the area of the chromatographic peaks using an electronic integrator (Spectra Physics Model 4270). 239 Results and discussion Ru/C samples having a metal content ranging between 0.5 and 10 wt.% were prepared and characterized by Og and CO chemisorption and by TEM. The results of chemisorption measurements are reported in Table 1. On each sample investigated, the CO and Og uptakes are similar, indicating that both gases chemisorb on the Ru surface with the same stoichiometry. On increasing the metal loading, the ratio between the amount of chemisorbed gas and the total Ru atoms decreases, suggesting the formation of larger Ru particles. The results have been confirmed by a TEM analysis of the Ru/C samples. Representative micrographs of the catalysts are shown in Fig. 1, while Fig. TABLE 1 da and CO uptakes over Ru/C samples Ru 02 CO 02/Ru CO/Ru (wt.%) (cm^STP^g-cat) (cm^STPVg-cat) 0.5 0.44 0.42 0.36 0.34 1 0.94 1.10 0.37 0.45 2 1.04 1.27 0.21 0.26 5 1.74 2.31 0.14 0.19 10 3.33 3.33 0.13 0.13 Fig. 1.

In order to derive reliable statistical averages for particle size distributions, several transmission electron micrographs for each catalyst were taken. The average Ru particle sizes, calculated from Fig. 2 by the equation: d=En(d,/En, are summarized in Table 2. Table 2 also reports the average Ru particle sizes calculated from the chemisorption data by means of the expression d=6V/5, where V is the volume of ruthenium and S the ruthenium surface area. Metal surface areas were measured assuming a ruthenium surface density of 1.63X1019 atoms m\"2 [19] and the stoichiometries Og/Ru^l and CO/Ru=l. From Table 2 it can be noted that the average Ru particle size measured by TEM is generally higher than that calculated by chemisorption. It is likely that this discrepancy is due to the limitation of our TEM instrumentation, which is not able to detect particles smaller than 30 A. Figure 3 shows typical results of cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation over Ru/C. Under the experimental conditions used, the main reaction products are hydrocinnamaldehyde (CeHg-CHg CHa CHO), hydrocinnamaldehyde 241 TABLE 2 Average metal particle size (d) and selectivity to cinnamyi alcohol (5caic) of Ru/C samples Ru Average particle size (A) Sadc (wt.%) riCOa) d(CO) d(TEM) (%) 0.5 37 40 <30 30 1 36 30 60 35 2 64 52 74 36 5 96 71 106 47 10 103 104 168 61 160 240 time (min) Fig. 3.

Formation of hydrocinnamaldehyde diethylacetal occurs readily through the reaction between hydrocinnamaldehyde and ethanol used as solvent. The diethylacetal was essentially at equilibrium with hydrocinnamaldehyde, which made them kinetically indistinguishable. Therefore in order to simplify the data they are reported together. Results reported in Fig. 3 show that the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde over Ru/C catalysts occurs via a reaction pathway (Scheme 1) similar to that previously observed over platinum-promoted catalysts [16]. Under steady state conditions C=C and C=0 groups are hydrogenated through parallel reactions with formation of saturated aldehyde and unsaturated alcohol. These 242 OH Scheme 1. two products are then further reduced to saturated alcohol and to the corresponding hydrocarbons. Hydrogenation of phenylpropanol was not ob- served. The kinetic analysis of the disappearance of cinnamaldehyde shows that on all Ru/C samples the experimental data can be fitted with a rate law which is first order with respect to the organic reactant. Therefore to compare the catalytic activities of the different Ru/C samples, the first-order rate constant, calculated by the expression: k = 1 /( ln(l - CC cald - Ccald)/C cald) has been used, in which C' caid and Ccaia represents the concentration of cinnamaldehyde at (=0 and t=t, respectively. A similar kinetic dependence has been previously reported over platinum- promoted catalysts [8]. In a more detailed kinetic study carried out over Pt Sn catalysts [16], the rate expression: r=fc'bC^d/(l+bCc,i<i) which is consistent with a Langmuir model, was found to best fit the experimental data. In the above rate equation, b represents the adsorption constant of cinnamaldehyde. If one considers that under the conditions used in this work b x Ccaid<se: 1, the overall reaction rate will be first order with respect to cinnamaldehyde, in agreement with the present results. Experiments carried out with different amounts of catalyst (Fig. 4) show a linear increase of the rate constant with the amount of catalyst used. These results, together with runs carried out under different stirring conditions, 243 50-, 40 30- 20- 10- 9RU-10\" Fig. 4. Influence of the amount of Ru on the reaction rate constant. (A) 2.0% Ru/C; ( ) 5.0% Ru/C. indicate that the reaction is performed in the absence of external diffusional limitations. The first-order rate constant measured on the Ru/C samples investigated was in the range 7-30 X 10~3 (g Ru)~1 s~1 depending on the Ru dispersion. Such values are significantly higher than those obtained under similar con- ditions on a 10% Pt/C catalyst, for which a rate constant of I.IIXIO\"3 (g Pt)~1 s~1 has been reported [12]. At higher pressure (4 MPa) and using as solvent a mixture isopropanol water sodium acetate, Giroir-Fendler et al. [11] have instead observed that Pt/C is more active than Ru/C. Selectivity to cinnamyi alcohol ( S'caic) was calculated by the expression S'caic^'-S'caicSC'p, in which Ccaic is the concentration of cinnamyi alcohol and SGp the total concentration of the products. At cinnamaldehyde conversions between 30 and 90%, 5'caic remained constant. At low conversion levels, it was however noted that 5'caic increases with reaction time as a result of the preferential formation of hydrocinna- maldehyde within the first minutes of the reaction. At higher conversions hydrocinnamaldehyde and cinnamyi alcohol are instead formed with the same ratio. Plotting Chcaid (concentration of hydrocinnamaldehyde) as a function of Ccaic, a linear relationship is in fact obtained (Fig. 5) with a positive intercept for Ccaic=0. The preferential formation of hydrocinnamaldehyde in the first stages of the reaction has been previously reported over Ir, Pt, Ru and Rh supported on activated carbon or on graphite [11, 14]. It has been suggested that hydrocinnamaldehyde molecules, formed in large amounts at the beginning of the reaction, remain adsorbed on the catalyst surface and modify the catalytic behaviour of the metal through: (a) a ligand effect which increases the charge density of the metal, lowering the probability for C=C activation; 244 a* a X u 10 20 30 40 ccalc (%1 Fig. 5. Hydrocinnamaldehyde concentration (Chcaid) as a function of cinnamyi alcohol con- centration (C^aic)- or (b) a steric effect which forces an oncoming molecule to adsorb via the C=0 group at the extremity of the molecule [11, 14]. In our case it should however be considered that at low conversions (C < 15%) decarbonylation of the unsaturated aldehyde has been also evi- denced. The amount of decarbonylation products is small (<2-3%) and remains constant at higher conversions. CO molecules formed through these side reactions could also be responsible for the initial changes observed in the catalytic performance. Over Re catalysts, Vanderspurt [7] has in fact reported that selectivity to unsaturated alcohol can be increased from 40 to 70% on exposure of the catalyst to a hydrogen stream containing 1% CO. The effect of carbon monoxide has been attributed either to a selective poisoning of the sites responsible for C=C hydrogenation or to an electronic modification of the metal sites induced by the chemisorbed CO. Figure 6 shows the rate constant as a function of ruthenium surface area as determined by Og and CO chemisorption. A linear relationship between catalytic activity and metal surface area was observed over the entire range of Ru dispersion studied. The specific rate of hydrogenation (expressed per atom of ruthenium on the surface) is therefore constant, independent of ruthenium particle size. A different effect of metal dispersion was instead found on the product distribution. Selectivities measured under steady state conditions show an increase with increasing average Ru particle size (Table 2). On the less dispersed sample (10% Ru/C) a selectivity to cinnamyi alcohol of 61% has been measured. This should be compared with the value of 30% found on 0.5% Ru/C. The possibility that this change in product distribution could be related to chlorine present on the surface has been ruled out by experiments carried out by impregnating the catalysts with different amounts of HC1. 245 40l 30- 20- 10 50 100 150 200 MSA (ni^g) Fig. 6. Influence of ruthenium surface area (MSA) on the rate constant of cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation. (A) from CO chemisorption; (A) from Oa chemisorption. It is known that the performance of a catalyst can be influenced by the degree of dispersion of the active component, i.e. its crystallite size, which determines the relative proportions of atoms on the corners, edges and faces of the crystallite. Atoms in different crystallographic positions can have different catalytic properties as a result of a different electronic and/or geometric structure. It may therefore be suggested that the organic reactant can adsorb on the Ru surface in different ways, i.e. through the C=C double bond, with formation of hydrocinnamaldehyde, or through the terminal C=0 group with formation of cinnamyi alcohol. If one assumes that adsorption through the C=C double bond is more abundant on the Ru atoms located on the comers or edges of the metal particles, an increase in the Ru crystallite size would lead to a decrease in the formation of saturated aldehyde. It should be however noted that the largest variations in selectivities are observed within a range of particle size where significant changes in the average coordination number and/or geometry of the Ru surface atoms are not expected. It is however possible that the observed results are related to the fact that in all cases small particles coexist together with larger ones. On increasing the average metal particle size, the contribution of the smaller particles decreases and therefore the formation of hydrocinnamaldehyde would decrease. An other possible explanation for the effect of metal particle size on the hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes has been recently suggested by Richard et al. [14]. On platinum-supported catalysts these authors have shown that higher selectivities to cinnamyi alcohol are obtained over platinum particles having a larger size. These results have been interpreted in terms of a steric effect. It has been in fact suggested that on the larger metal particles the aromatic ring which is not bonded to the surface lies at a 246 distance exceeding 0.3 nm due to the presence of an energy barrier which prevents a closer approach [20]. Under these conditions the cinnamaldehyde molecule is tilted and the C==0 extremity will be closer to the surface with respect to the C=C bond. Thus it can be expected that on the flat planes C=0 is easily activated.

        "dc:description": "Hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde has been carried out over Ru catalysts supported on activated carbon at 333 K and atmospheric pressure using ethanol as solvent. The activity and selectivity of Ru/C catalysts have been investigated in order to elucidate the effect of metal particle size on the hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes. The specific activity expressed per Ru surface atom remains constant with metal dispersion, indicating that the rate-determining step of the reaction is structure-insensitive. Selectivity to cinnamyl alcohol increases with Ru particle size, reaching a value of about 60% on the less dispersed samples.",
