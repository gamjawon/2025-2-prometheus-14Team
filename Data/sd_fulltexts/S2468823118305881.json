Graphical abstract Hydrogen adsorption configurations and stable concentrations on a group of MoP surfaces [(001), (100), (101), (102), (110), (111), (112)] at different conditions have been theoretically investigated with DFT and atomistic thermodynamics methods. Our systematic studies suggest that dissociative H2 adsorption is favored on MoP catalyst, and the saturation coverage ranges from one to four monolayers (ML) on different surfaces. Additionally, the stable hydrogen concentration on each surface at any temperature and H2 partial pressure could be easily identified from the established equilibrium phase diagrams. Interestingly, hydrogen adsorptions modified the MoP surfaces stabilities, and eventually changed the morphologies of MoP nanoparticle. (100) and (101) surfaces are found to be most stable and dominant at wide ranges of temperatures and H2 partial pressures, which indicates their potentially key roles in determining catalytic properties of MoP catalyst. These findings agree reasonably with available experimental XRD and TEM measurements. Most importantly, the numbers and ratios of exposed surfaces on MoP nanoparticle could be adjusted by manipulating preparation temperatures and pressures. Our investigations provide essential information for selective synthesis of MoP catalyst with specific structures experimentally. Keywords MoP Surface stability Morphology DFT 1 Introduction Molybdenum based catalysts including MoP, Mo2C and MoS2 have been widely investigated for their low cost and superior catalytic activities in many catalysis processes, such as syngas conversion to hydrocarbon or oxygenated chemicals [1], biorefinery [2,3], and advanced hydroprocessing [4]. Among them, MoP is well-known for its excellent electrical and catalytic activity, such as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) [5–9], hydrogen oxidation reaction(HOR) [10], CO2 electroreduction [11] and direct methanol oxidization reaction (DMOR) [12]; hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) [13], hydrodesulfurization (HDS) [14,15], hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) [16,17], hydrodechlorination (HDC) [18], and hydroisomerization [19]. More specifically, MoP was regarded as a promising anode material for lithium-ion batteries [20,21], and also had high activity and selectivity in alcohol synthesis from syngas [22,23], especially promoted by the alkali metals and/or transition metals. Recently, MoP has been proved to be an attractive catalyst for CO and CO2 hydrogenation to methanol [24]. In addition, the observed physical topological properties [25,26], and lattice thermal conductivity anisotropy [27] will further extend the wide applications of MoP in material science and catalysis. In the last decade, wide theoretical investigations focused on the adsorption of small molecules [28–31] and hydro-treating reaction mechanisms on MoP [32–38]. Clearly, hydrogen plays an indispensable role in MoP catalyzed reactions. For one thing, hydrogen is the key reactant of the hydrogenation reaction. For another, it is the product of dehydrogenation reactions. Furthermore, it is a very important species to avoid the coking of catalyst. Actually, the essential role of surface H atoms in hydrogenations is already highlighted by Shan et al., [39]. In this respect, exploring hydrogen interaction mechanism with MoP catalyst is meaningful in understanding the hydro-treating reaction mechanism. However, previous theoretical investigations of hydrogen adsorption on MoP mainly focused on identifying the site preference of one H2 molecule or single H atom on the (100) and (001) surfaces [40–44]. Nevertheless, such limited information could not give a full picture of hydrogen interaction with MoP catalyst because of the versatile surface structures under experimental conditions [43,45–47]. In this respect, comprehensive studies of hydrogen adsorption and dissociation on different MoP surfaces are highly desired. Meanwhile, the effect of experimental conditions on surface hydrogen concentration as well as MoP catalyst morphology is also an important scientific issue to be addressed. Here, coverage dependent hydrogen adsorption on seven MoP surfaces with different terminations were systematically investigated with DFT based thermodynamics method. We are seeking to identify the site preference as well as experimental condition dependent stable concentration of H on different MoP surfaces on the one hand, and reveal the morphology changes of MoP catalyst under hydrogen atmosphere on the other hand. 2 Computational details 2.1 Methods All the DFT calculations were performed with the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) [48,49]. The projected augmented wave method (PAW) [50] was applied and the electron exchange and correlation energies were calculated within the generalized gradient approximation with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (GGA-PBE) functional [51,52]. A cutoff energy of 400 eV was set. The structure relaxation was done when the force tolerance and energy difference became lower than 0.02 eV/Å and 10–4 eV, respectively. All the reported energetics included zero-point energy correction. Adsorption energy (E ads) of one H2 molecule is calculated by E ads = E(H2/slab) – E(H2) – E(slab), where E(H2/slab) is the total energy of the slab with adsorbed H2 molecule, E(H2) is the total energy of H2 in gas phase, and E(slab) is the total energy of the clean surface. Adsorption energy (E ads) of one H atom is calculated by E ads = E(H/slab) – 1/2E(H2) – E(slab), where E(H/slab) is the total energy of the slab with adsorbed H atom in its equilibrium geometry. A more negative E ads indicates a more stable adsorption. At high coverage, differential adsorption energy (ΔE ads = E[Hn+1/slab] – E[Hn/slab] – 1/2E(H2) is used, where n is the number of adsorbed H atoms. The saturation coverage is reached at ΔE ads > 0. Transition-state structures of H2 dissociation are estimated using the climbing image nudged elastic band method (CI-NEB) [53]. All transition states are verified by vibration analyses with only one imaginary frequency. The energy barrier (E a) is calculated according to E a = E TS – E IS, where E IS is the total energy of the most stable H2 molecule adsorption state (initial state, IS) on MoP surface, and E TS is the total energy of the transition state. The dissociation energy (E r) is calculated according E r = E FS – E IS, where E FS is the total energy of the H2 dissociative adsorption final state (FS) on MoP surface. Ab initio atomistic thermodynamics [54–58] was applied to include the effects of experimental conditions. The detailed description of the method can be found in the Supplementary Information section (SI). 2.2 Models The calculated lattice constant of the WC-type MoP bulk crystal structure is a = b = 3.239 Å, c = 3.193 Å, agree well with the experimental values (a = b = 3.223 Å and c = 3.191 Å) [59]. For hydrogen adsorption, we used the p(3 × 3)-10 L/R4(atomic layers of slab/relaxed atomic layers), p(3 × 3)-8 L/R4, p(3 × 3)-8 L/R4, p(2 × 3)-8 L/R4, p(2 × 2)-14 L/R6, p(3 × 2)-5 L/R3, p(2 × 2)-14/LR6, p(2 × 2)-7 L/R5 supercells for the (001)-P, (001)-Mo, (100), (101), (102), (110), (111), (112) facets, which were proved to be stable and representative surfaces of MoP nanoparticle by our recently developed theoretical methodology [60]. The 3 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point grid was applied for all surfaces to sample the Brillouin zone. A vacuum layer of 15 Å was set between the periodically repeated slabs to avoid strong interactions. 3 Result and discussion 3.1 Surface structures and adsorption sites Fig. 1 presents the schematic structures and possible adsorption sites of seven chosen surfaces. On both P and Mo terminations of (001) surface, there are one top site (T), two bridge sites (B1 and B2) and two hollow sites (H1 and H2). T, B and H represent the site which has hydrogen interacting with one, two and more than three surface atoms, respectively. On the Mo/P mixed termination of (101) surface, there are two top sites (T1 and T2), four bridge sites (B1, B2, B3 and B4) and four hollow sites (H1, H2, H3 and H4). On the Mo/P mixed termination of (111) surface, there are three top sites (T1, T2 and T3) and six bridge sites (B1, B2, B3, B4, B5 and B6). On the (100)-Mo termination, two top sites (T1 and T2) and three bridge sites (B1, B2 and B3) are possible. On the Mo/P mixed termination of (110) surface, two top sites (T1 and T2), five bridge sites (B1, B2, B3, B4 and B5) and two hollow sites (H1 and H2) are possible. On the Mo/P mixed termination of (112) surface, there are four top sites (T1,T2, T3 and T4), eight bridge sites (B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7 and B8) and four hollow sites (H1, H2, H3 and H4). On the Mo/P mixed termination of (102) surface, there are three top sites (T1, T2 and T3), five bridge sites (B1, B2, B3, B4, and B5) and one hollow site (H). 3.2 H2 adsorption and dissociation Despite of many possible adsorption sites, only few of them could form stable H adsorption. Table 1 listed the adsorption energies of H2 on different sites. Based on the calculated enthalpies of different states during H2 adsorption and dissociation, it is found that on the P termination of (001) surface, H2 only forms weak and physical adsorption with the adsorption energy of 0.04 eV, but the dissociation is highly exothermic (-1.41 eV) and has very low barrier (0.08 eV). However, molecular H2 could form stable adsorption (-0.71 eV) on the Mo termination of (001) surface, the H2 dissociation barrier is also very low (0.04 eV) and the dissociation process is exothermic (-1.08 eV). Similarly, molecular H2 can form stable chemisorption on Mo atom of other six surfaces with the adsorption energy of -0.54, -0.51, -0.66, -0.64, -0.46, -0.80 eV on (101), (111), (100), (110), (112) and (102) surfaces, respectively (all the transition state structures of H2 dissociation could be found in Fig. S1). Meanwhile, H2 dissociation barriers are lower than 0.05 eV on all six surfaces and the dissociation processes are all exothermic. All these results indicate that the preferable adsorption state of hydrogen on MoP surfaces are dissociated H atoms, which also agrees well with available theoretical studies on (001)-P, (001)-Mo and (100) surfaces [40–44]. 3.3 H atom adsorption at different coverage Clearly, H2 dissociative adsorption is feasible on MoP surfaces based on the above results. To explore the surface structure and reaction condition dependent hydrogen coverage on MoP surfaces, we therefore systematically identified the stable adsorption structures of nH atoms at different coverage, where the differential adsorption energy (ΔE ads) is used to determine the saturation coverage. The adsorption energies of single H atom at different adsorption sites are listed in Table 1. The 1 ML coverage defines the ratio of the adsorbed H atoms to surface Mo atoms (P atoms for (001)-P termination) of the first atomic layer. On (001)-P termination at the lowest coverage (Fig. S2), H atom forms most stable adsorption at the T site with E ads = -0.68 eV. With the increase of hydrogen coverage, the differential adsorption energy gradually decreases. Finally, the saturation coverage is reached at 9H atoms (1 ML) because of the positive differential adsorption energy at nH = 10 and all H atoms locate at the T sites. On (001)-Mo termination at the lowest coverage (Fig. S3), H atom forms most stable adsorption at the H1 site with E ads = -0.95 eV, and the saturation coverage has 16H atoms (16/9 ML) on both H1 and T sites. On (101) surface at the lowest coverage (Fig. S4), H atom forms most stable adsorption at the B1 site bridging two surface Mo atoms with E ads = -0.73 eV, and the saturation coverage has 12H (2 ML) atoms on both B1 and T2 sites. On (111) surface at the lowest coverage (Fig. S5), H atom forms most stable adsorption at the B1 site bridging one first layer Mo and one second layer Mo atoms with E ads = -0.43 eV, and the saturation coverage has 16H atoms (4 ML) on T1, B1 and B2 sites. On (100) surface at the lowest coverage (Fig. S6), H atom forms most stable adsorption at the B1 site bridging two first layer Mo atoms with E ads = -0.57 eV, and the saturation coverage has 18H atoms (2 ML) on B1 and B2 sites. On (110) surface at the lowest coverage (Fig. S7), H atom forms most stable adsorption at the B1 site bridging two Mo atoms with E ads = -0.59 eV, and the saturation coverage has 24H atoms (4 ML) on T1, T2, B1 and B5 sites. On (112) surface at the lowest coverage (Fig. S8), H atom forms most stable adsorption at B1 site bridging one first layer Mo atom and one second layer Mo atom with E ads = -0.62 eV, and the saturation coverage has 16H atoms (4 ML) on T1, B1, B3 and B7 sites. On (102) surface at the lowest coverage (Fig. S9), H atom forms most stable adsorption at B1 site bridging two first layer Mo atoms with E ads = -1.06 eV, and the saturation coverage has 12H atoms (3 ML) on B1, B2 and B3 sites. All the H adsorption structures at saturation coverage are shown in Fig. 2 . 3.4 Stable hydrogen coverage with T and pH2 Based on above systematic static DFT computations, the stable H adsorption configuration at any coverage till saturation was clearly identified. However, identification of stable H coverage at experimental relevant conditions could provide more useful information for understanding MoP related catalysis issues. Therefore, we here introduce ab initio atomistic thermodynamics method to include the effects of temperature (T) and hydrogen pressure ( p H2 ) on hydrogen coverage. On the basis of the method described in SI, phase diagrams of hydrogen stable coverage on each MoP surface are established and shown in Fig. 3 . Clearly, each phase diagram includes several regions representing different stable hydrogen coverage under given conditions. Furthermore, the stable hydrogen coverage decreases with increasing temperature at given pressures, and increases with H2 partial pressure at given temperature. Taking (001)-P surface in Fig. 3a as an example, at 1 atm (lg(p H2/p θ) = 0), the stable H coverage is 9 H/1 ML at about 0 ˜ 50 K, and then decreases to 8H (8/9 ML) at about 50 ˜ 290 K, 7H (7/9 ML) at about 290 ˜ 490 K, 6 H(2/3 ML) at about 490 ˜770 K, 5H (5/9 ML) at about 770 ˜ 890 K, 4H (4/9 ML) at about 890 ˜ 1010 K. Finally, none of H atoms could stay on the surface at above 1020 K. Similarly, at fixed temperature, i.e., 200 K, the stable H coverage is 7H at p H2 = 10−10 atm (lg(p H2/p θ) = -10), then increases to 8H at p H2 = 10-3 atm (lg(p H2/p θ) = -3), and finally to saturated 9H at p H2 = 104 atm (lg(p H2/p θ) = 4). It is worth noting that one can easily estimate the stable hydrogen coverage at any given T and p H2 on each MoP surface based on these equilibrium phase diagrams in Fig. 3. Close inspections also show that stable hydrogen coverage on each surface is different even under the same conditions, indicating their potentially different hydro-treating activities. Indeed, another potential application of these diagrams is related to the simulation of temperature programmed desorption (TPD) spectrum of hydrogen on MoP surfaces under UHV conditions with a base pressure of around 1 × 10−10 Torr (lg(p H2/p θ) ≈ -13). To this end, we further estimate hydrogen desorption temperatures on each MoP surface. For instance, full hydrogen desorption temperature is about 380, 510, 400, 260, 350, 330, 340 and 560 K on the (001)-P, (001)-Mo, (101), (111), (100), (110), (112) and (102) surfaces, respectively. Actually, such TPD information on MoP catalyst is not yet available experimentally. We believe further experimental studies in combination with our results will strength the understanding of MoP surface properties. 3.5 The morphology of MoP catalyst under hydrogen atmosphere Our recent study showed that under ideal vacuum condition, six MoP surfaces could expose on Wulff shape, and the contribution of each surface follows: (101) - 36.2% > (112) - 24.1% > (100) - 19.3% > (111) - 12.3% > (110) - 4.3% > (102) - (3.8%). Experimentally, hydrogen played an essential role in both MoP catalyst preparation and hydro-treating reaction processes. In this case, revealing the morphology of MoP catalysts under hydrogen atmosphere will provide better understanding of MoP properties. We therefore considered the effects of hydrogen adsorption on the surface stability and morphology of the MoP catalyst. The ab initio atomistic thermodynamics method was applied to get the adsorption Gibbs free energy, which is used to evaluate the influences of hydrogen adsorption on the surface free energies. The detailed introduction of the method is given in the SI. As listed in Table 2 , surface free energies of each surface have clear dependences from temperatures and p H2. Note that hydrogen adsorption lowered the surface free energies and changed the stability orders of MoP surfaces. For example, the most stable surface is MoP(101) under ideal vacuum condition, but (100) becomes most stable at 0 K and p H2 = 1 atm, which reveals the clear influence of hydrogen adsorption on surface stability. Furthermore, the changes in surface energies eventually modified the morphologies of MoP catalyst. We therefore applied Wulff construction [61] to show the morphologies changes of the MoP catalyst at different conditions. Experimentally, temperatures for the synthesis of MoP catalyst range from 673 K to 923 K, and hydro-treating reactions are usually performed at 393 K to 843 K. We thus choose four temperatures 0, 425, 575 and 850 K and p H2 = 1 atm to show the temperature dependent MoP morphology changes. As shown in Fig. 4 , only four surfaces expose on Wulff shape at 0 K and p H2 = 1 atm, and the (100) surface has the largest contribution (58.8%), followed by (101), (001) and (111). With the increase of temperature, the proportions of (100) and (001) surfaces decrease while that of (111) increases. At 425 K and p H2 = 1 atm, all seven surfaces could expose, and (101) surface becomes the dominant surface (63.0%), followed by (100), (111), (001), (110), (112) and (102). At 575 K and p H2 = 1 atm, the contribution order changes to be (101)> (100)> (111)> (112)> (110)> (102)> (001). At 850 K and p H2 = 1 atm, the (001) surface disappear, and the contribution order follows: (101)> (111)> (112)> (100) > (102)> (110). Similarly, the morphologies of MoP also present clear changes with H2 partial pressures at fixed temperature, which are given in SI (see Fig. S10). In general, the (101) and (100) are most stable and dominant surfaces of MoP nanoparticle at a wide range of temperature and H2 partial pressures, which indicates their potentially key roles in determining catalytic properties of MoP catalyst. Actually, this finding is in good agreement with available experimental results. For example, experimental XRD measurements [43,45] indicated that (101) has the strongest XRD intensity followed by (100) surface. TEM results [62] also identify the existence of (101) surface on MoP catalyst. Nevertheless, it should be noted that those less exposed surfaces can also play very essential roles during catalytic reactions. In this respect, the detailed reaction mechanisms (CO or CO2 hydrogenations, etc.) on different surfaces are highly desired for understanding MoP catalysts, which are actually our ongoing efforts. With the catalytic properties of each surface in hand, one can selectively synthesis MoP catalyst with specific surfaces by manipulating the preparation temperatures and pressures based on the information in Fig. 4 as well as Fig. S10. 4 Conclusion Density functional theory calculation was used to investigate the adsorption and dissociation of H2 on the (001), (100), (101), (102), (110), (111) and (112) surfaces of MoP catalyst. Based on the adsorption energies at different coverage, ab initio atomistic thermodynamics was applied to study the hydrogen adsorption properties at different temperature and pressure. In addition, Wulff construction was used to describe the morphology changes of MoP catalyst. It is found that on MoP surfaces, H2 dissociative adsorption is very preferable and the dissociation barriers are considerably low. However, each surface has quite different saturation coverage, i.e., the P-termination of (001) surface has one monolayer (1 ML), (001)-Mo has 16/9 ML, (100) and (101) surfaces have 2 ML, (102) has 3 ML, while (110), (111) and (112) surfaces have 4 ML. Such information indicates the distinct hydro-treating abilities of different MoP surfaces. Taking temperatures and H2 partial pressures into account, the equilibrium phase diagrams of hydrogen adsorptions were built, which describe the relationship between the stable H coverage and experimental relevant conditions. Clearly, the stable hydrogen concentration on each surface at any temperature and H2 partial pressure could be easily identified from these phase diagrams. In addition, hydrogen full desorption temperatures on these surfaces under UHV conditions range from 260 to 560 K. Interestingly, hydrogen adsorptions could also modify the stabilities of different MoP surfaces, which results in obvious morphologies changes of MoP nanoparticle. (100) and (101) surfaces are found to be most stable and dominant at a wide range of temperatures and H2 partial pressures, which indicates their potentially key roles in determining catalytic properties of MoP catalyst. These findings agree reasonably with available experimental XRD and TEM measurements. Most importantly, the numbers and ratios of exposed surfaces on MoP nanoparticle could be adjusted by manipulating preparation temperatures and pressures. Our investigations provide essential basis for selectively synthesis of MoP catalyst with specific structures experimentally.
