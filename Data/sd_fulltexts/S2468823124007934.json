School of Environmental Science and Engineering Changzhou University Changzhou 213164 China This study introduces a novel catalyst system comprising Pd nanoparticles loaded onto Mn-doped NiO for the efficient oxidation of methane (CH4) at low temperatures. The loading of Pd nanoparticles onto the Mn-doped support has yielded a catalyst with exceptional activity and stability, as evidenced by the lowest T50 temperature of 276 °C and a CH4 conversion reaching 97% at 325 °C. The catalyst demonstrates optimized reaction kinetics with the lowest activation energy of 69.2 kJ mol–1. The catalyst's superior performance is attributed to the synergistic effects of the Pd/Mn-NiO composite, which include a higher Pd2+/Pd4+ ratio, increased adsorptive oxygen concentration (Oads/Ototal), and a reduced Ni3+/Ni2+ ratio. These characteristics collectively enhance the catalytic activity for CH4 oxidation. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism underpins the oxidation process, with Pd2+ identified as the principal active site for CH4 adsorption and dissociation. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy coupled with mass spectrometry elucidates the pathway of surface reactive oxygen species in the formation of key intermediates, such as formates, and underscores the accelerated decomposition of carbonate facilitated by the Pd modification on the Mn-NiO surface. The findings signify a significant advancement in the development of catalysts for environmental and energy-related applications, particularly in the mitigation of CH4 emissions.

These qualities have driven its extensive use in the production of clean energy and across various industrial sectors [1,2]. However, the release of CH4 during its production and utilization poses dual challenges: it results in energy loss and intensifies environmental concerns. CH4 is the second most potent greenhouse gas, with a warming potential more than 20 times that of carbon dioxide (CO2) [3,4]. Recent findings indicate that CH4 contributes to roughly 30% of the increase in global temperatures since the industrial revolution [5]. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the principal sources of CH4 emissions are wetlands, agriculture, and the energy sector, with human activities accounting for approximately 60% of the total emissions. In the Global Methane Tracker, emissions from the end-use of coal, oil products, and natural gas are estimated to be 3 Mt, representing 3% of energy-related methane emissions [6]. Therefore, immediate and sustained efforts to reduce CH4 emissions are essential for curbing short-term global warming and enhancing air quality. Regulatory measures have been implemented to curb CH4 emissions, particularly in the United States, the European Union (EU), and China. In the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Energy (DOE) have announced an investment of $850 million aimed at reducing methane pollution from the oil and gas sector [7,8]. The EU has enacted a new methane regulation designed to mitigate harmful emissions from fossil fuels within Europe and beyond [9]. Similarly, China has promulgated regulations aimed at reducing CH4 emissions [10]. Catalytic combustion of CH4 represents a promising approach to mitigate CH4 emissions from industrial processes. However, the low-temperature oxidation of CH4 poses a significant challenge due to the molecule's inherent stability and the substantial energy barrier required to cleave the CH bonds during combustion reactions [11,12]. Transition metal oxide catalysts, such as MnOx, NiO, ZrO2, and Co3O4, have been extensively studied for their roles in CH4 oxidation. Among these, NiO, a P-type semiconductor, features an intrinsic defect at the Ni2+ metal site [13]. The catalytic performance of NiO can be fine-tuned by modifying the morphology and mesoporous structure of the nano catalysts. Chen et al. employed a solid-liquid NH3 precipitation method to synthesize NiO nanomaterials, demonstrating the capability for complete CH4 combustion at 390 °C [14]. Additionally, M (a second metal)-doped NiO catalysts have garnered considerable attention for their potential in CH4 oxidation [15]. For instance, Ni0.89Zr0.11O2−δ, prepared by Wang et al. using a homogeneous coprecipitation method, exhibited enhanced low-temperature CH4 oxidation activity, with a T90 value of 380 °C. This improvement was attributed to an increased presence of Ni3+ ions and electrophile O− species, which are effective for activating CH bonds [16]. Furthermore, Mn ions are regarded as a promising dopant candidate due to their suitable ionic radius, excellent oxygen storage capacity, and reversible valence state cycling. These properties have been leveraged in applications such as hydrogen evolution reactions and self-oxidation reactions [17,18]. Although M-NiO catalysts have shown promising progress in the realm of CH4 oxidation, they seldom achieve complete CH4 conversion at 350 °C, indicating that the low-temperature catalytic performance requires further enhancement. The strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) effect, widely recognized in heterogeneous catalysis, has been demonstrated to effectively improve catalytic activity by adjusting the size and valence state of the precious metal nanoparticles supported on the carrier [19-22]. Pd-based catalysts, in particular, are regarded as the most active for CH4 combustion [23,24]. However, due to the propensity of PdO to sinter and agglomerate, and its poor hydrothermal stability, the addition of a metal oxide carrier is essential. For instance, Chen et al. reported that CH4 oxidation over Pd/CeO2 follows the Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism, with Pd2+ species identified as the active center for CH4 catalytic oxidation [25]. Li et al. have elucidated the CH4 oxidation process on Pd/ZrO2 through diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, suggesting that a low concentration of surface OH groups facilitates electron transfer [26]. While Pd-supported mono-metal oxide catalysts have been extensively studied for CH4 oxidation mechanisms, a systematic analysis of Pd-supported bimetallic oxides remains scarce. The objective of this study is to enhance the low-temperature catalytic oxidation of CH4 by loading Pd onto Mn-doped NiO. The Mn-doped NiO is prepared using the aerosol pyrolysis method, and Pd is subsequently impregnated onto the Mn-doped NiO via the wet impregnation method. The catalytic activity for CH4 oxidation is evaluated using a fixed-bed flow reactor, yielding data on the activation energy and the stability of CH4 oxidation for the catalyst. A suite of characterization techniques is employed to examine the catalyst's morphology, crystallographic features, and surface composition. Operando DRIFTS coupled with a mass spectrometry (MS) is utilized to observe the changes in surface-related functional groups during the CH4 oxidation process. Based on these observations, a mechanism is proposed that highlights the synergistic enhancement of low-temperature CH4 oxidation by Pd and Mn-doped NiO. 2 Methods 2.1 Catalyst preparation 2.1.1 Carrier preparation The Mn-doped NiO catalyst was synthesized via aerosol pyrolysis, as depicted in Fig. S1. The specific procedure is outlined below: Nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Sinopharm, China) and a manganese nitrate solution (Mn(NO3)2, 50 wt.% in H2O, Shanghai Aladdin, China) were mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio. Deionized water was added to achieve a total volume of 50 mL. After thorough mixing, the solution was placed into a Pyrex bottle (500 mL) equipped with an ultrasonic atomizer (ZP-01, Chenyang Electric, China). The atomized mist, mixed with a flow of N2 gas at 1 L min–1, was passed through a tube preheated to 70 °C to enhance the vaporization of water in the nitrate mists, forming nitrate aerosols. The gas stream carrying the nitrate aerosols was then directed into a quartz tube for high-temperature decomposition at 600 °C. The resulting particles from the nitrate decomposition were collected using two-stage water adsorbers. The collected water colloid was transferred to a centrifuge tube and subjected to high-speed centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 3 min to yield solid precipitate. The solid precipitate was then washed with deionized water and ethanol two to three times, followed by drying in an oven at 80 °C for 12 h. The resulting dried solid sample was designated as Mn-NiO. The NiO catalyst was prepared using the same procedure without the addition of manganese nitrate. 2.1.2 Pd/Mn-NiO preparation The Pd/Mn-NiO and Pd/NiO catalysts were prepared using the wet impregnation technique. Palladium nitrate dihydrate (Pd(NO3)2·2H2O, supplied by Macklin, China) served as the impregnating agent. A 5-g solid sample of Mn-NiO or NiO was immersed in the Pd precursor solution for 2 h at ambient temperature, then left to age in darkness for 12 h. Subsequently, the catalysts were dried in an oven at 80 °C for 6 h and further calcined in a muffle furnace at 300 °C for 2 h. By carefully adjusting the amount of Pd(NO3)2·2H2O, catalysts with a consistent Pd loading of 1% by mass were produced for both formulations. This particular loading was selected for its superior performance in CH4 conversion, as determined through comparative studies with CH4 oxidation on catalysts containing 0.5%, 0.7%, and 1.5% Pd on Mn-NiO2, as depicted in Fig. S2. 2.2 Catalyst characterization The morphology and structure of the catalysts were characterized using a suite of analytical techniques, including scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) together with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometry, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). The electron valence information at the catalyst's surface was obtained through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Furthermore, the catalyst's properties were examined using hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), and oxygen temperature-programmed desorption (O2-TPD). Operando DRIFTS-MS was used explore the surface reaction process. Detailed experimental procedures are provided in the Supplementary Material (SM). 2.3 Catalyst evaluation A continuous-flow quartz reactor, charged with catalyst powder, was utilized to investigate the oxidation of CH4 at various temperatures within an electric furnace (KLL-6D-11, Longkou Xianke, China). The reactor was loaded with 200 mg of catalyst powder (40–60 mesh) and secured with quartz wool to ensure even distribution and prevent powder dispersion. A gas mixture comprising 0.3vol% CH4 and 10vol% O2 was introduced into the reactor at a flow rate of 100 mL min–1, balanced with nitrogen (N2), resulting in a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 30,000 mL (g h)–1. CH4 and CO2 concentrations in the gas mixture at the reactor's inlet and outlet were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC9790 II, Zhejiang Fuli, China). Calculations pertaining to CH4 conversion, turnover frequency (TOF), activation energy (Ea ), and catalyst's grain size (D) are elaborated upon in the SM. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 CH4 oxidation Fig. 1 a shows the CH4 oxidation on the four catalysts. The performance of CH4 oxidation can be assessed by the temperature required to achieve a 50% conversion rate, denoted as the T50 temperature. For NiO, the T50 temperature is 445 °C. In contrast, Mn-doped NiO exhibits a significantly reduced T50 temperature of 336 °C. The 111 °C reduction in T50 temperature for Mn-doped NiO compared to undoped NiO demonstrates that Mn doping substantially enhances the catalyst's CH4 oxidation activity. Furthermore, the T50 temperature for Pd-loaded NiO (Pd/NiO) is 304 °C, which is 141 °C lower than that of NiO. This decrease indicates that the introduction of Pd also significantly improves the catalyst's activity for CH4 oxidation. When Pd is loaded onto NiO (Pd/Mn-NiO), the T50 temperature is further reduced to 276 °C. This temperature is 60 °C lower than that of Mn-doped NiO alone, marking it as the catalyst with the lowest T50 temperature among those evaluated. This suggests that Pd/Mn-NiO catalyst confers superior activity for CH4 oxidation compared to NiO. The comparison of TOF values is presented in Table S1. The TOF value for the Pd/Mn-NiO catalyst is found to be nearly equivalent to that of PdNi/Al2O3, yet it remains lower than those observed for other palladium-loaded catalysts. Fig. 1b illustrates the activation energy (Ea ) values determined through Arrhenius linear fitting. The calculated Ea for the CH4 oxidation over NiO is 118 kJ mol–1, while the Ea for Mn-doped NiO is somewhat lower at 92.1 kJ mol–1. This reduction in Ea indicates that Mn doping enhances the catalytic activity by lowering the energy barrier for the reaction. Upon loading Pd onto the catalysts, the activation energies are further decreased. Specifically, Pd/NiO exhibits an Ea of 83.9 kJ mol–1, and Pd/Mn-NiO has an even lower Ea of 69.2 kJ mol–1, which is close to that of CH4 oxidation on Pd/SnO2 and Pd/CeO2 (Table S1). These results suggest that the loading of Pd significantly facilitates the CH4 oxidation process, with Pd/Mn-NiO demonstrating the highest improvement in catalytic activity among the evaluated catalysts. The stability test outcomes for Pd/Mn-NiO and Pd/NiO catalysts during CH4 oxidation at 325 °C are depicted in Fig. 1c. Over a period of 20 h, the Pd/Mn-NiO catalyst maintains a stable CH4 conversion within the range of 90%−95%. The stability of Pd/NiO is maintained at 40%−45%. Fig. S3. shows the stability test results at 400 °C. The conversion of Pd/Mn-NiO was stabilized at more than 99% within 20 h. In comparison, the Pd/NiO catalyst was somewhat lower stability, decreasing from 99% to 95% after 20 h. These results indicate that the addition of Mn can enhance the thermal stability of the catalyst. 3.2 Structure and morphology Fig. 2 presents the XRD, Raman and EPR spectra of the catalysts. Characteristic peaks corresponding to NiO (PDF#47–1049) were observed in all four catalysts, as shown in Fig. 2a. The primary diffraction peaks at 2θ angles of 36.95°, 43.16°, and 64.68° are consistent with the crystalline structure of NiO. The absence of diffraction peaks for Pd or PdO in the Pd/Mn-NiO and Pd/NiO catalysts suggests that palladium species are highly dispersed on the carrier surface. The grain size (D) calculated using the Scherrer equation from the principal crystal plane and full width at half maximum (FWHM) of each catalyst are detailed in Table 1 and Table S2. The D value of Pd/Mn-NiO closely resembles that of Mn-NiO, suggesting that the loading of Pd does not significantly impact the crystalline properties of Mn-NiO. Consistent with this observation, Pd loading onto NiO also appears to have no substantial effect on the intrinsic crystal properties of the NiO phase. The crystallinity of Mn-NiO seems to be lower than that of NiO, as evidenced by the broader FWHM of each crystallographic peak and the reduced crystal size (Table S2). This finding suggests that the introduction of Mn leads to lattice distortion. Additionally, it was noted that the average grain sizes of Pd/Mn-NiO and Mn-NiO were considerably diminished following Mn doping. This reduction in grain size contributes to an increase in the number of grain interfaces, which can potentially enhance the catalytic activity. As shown in Fig. S4, all four catalysts exhibit a type IV isotherm typical of the hysteresis behavior of mesoporous materials. Table S3 lists the average pore size, pore volume and specific surface area of the four catalysts. Pd loading results in the reduction of specific surface area, which may be due to the blockage of the porous carrier by Pd particles. Obviously, Pd/Mn-NiO has larger specific surface area, pore volume and pore size than Pd/NiO, which is caused by Mn doping. Raman spectroscopy analysis was conducted on the four catalysts, as depicted in Fig. 2b. For NiO and Pd/NiO, the spectra were deconvoluted into two sub-peaks. The peak observed at 390 cm−1 is assigned to the first-order transverse optical (TO) phonon mode, which arises from the vibration of the Ni3+-O bond due to the presence of Ni2+ vacancies. The peak at approximately 502 cm−1 is associated with the first-order longitudinal optical (LO) phonon mode, corresponding to the vibration of the Ni2+-O bond within the NiO lattice [27]. The Raman spectra of Mn-NiO and Pd/Mn-NiO were fitted with three peaks. A distinct new band emerged at 630 cm⁻¹ for both Mn-NiO and Pd/Mn-NiO, which can be attributed to the A1g vibration mode of the symmetric Mn-O stretching within the MnO6 octahedral structure [28]. The ratio of peak areas of Ni3+ to Ni2+ (INi 3+/INi 2+) for each catalyst was determined using a multi-peak fitting method, with the results presented in Table 1. It was observed that the loading of Pd led to a reduction in the INi 3+/INi 2+ ratio, suggesting that the incorporation of Pd phase reduced the Ni3+ content on the catalyst surface. Furthermore, the variation in the INi 3+/INi 2+ ratio in Pd/Mn-NiO is also associated with the strengthening of Mn-O bonds [29,30,31]. The EPR spectra of the four catalysts are presented in Fig. 2c. The primary source of the EPR response is attributed to oxygen vacancies with unpaired electrons [32]. The EPR spectrum of NiO exhibits a low-intensity signal at approximately 350.7 mT, potentially due to the presence of impurities or electrons trapped near the surface associated with the Ni2+/Ni3+ reoxidation-reduction pair [33]. The EPR signal observed for Mn-NiO may be ascribed to the antiferromagnetic coupling between Ni2+ and Mn4+ ions [34]. The introduction of Pd species influences the g factor, causing it to shift towards a lower magnetic field. By comparing the symmetric peak intensities at the g factor, the relative oxygen vacancy concentrations among the catalysts were determined to follow the order: Pd/Mn-NiO > Pd/NiO > Mn-NiO > NiO. Based on these observations, it is concluded that the doping of Mn into the NiO matrix effectively facilitates electron transfer between Pd and the carrier, leading to an increased generation of oxygen vacancies. These vacancies are beneficial for the activation and migration of oxygen species during CH4 oxidation. Electron microscopy images of Pd/Mn-NiO and Pd/NiO are displayed in Fig. 3 . The Pd/NiO catalyst consists of large Pd particles with a non-uniform particle size distribution, averaging 7.5 ± 0.5 nm. Well-arranged lattice fringes reveal the presence of well-crystallized NiO (111) and (200) planes, with interplanar spacings of approximately 0.204 and 0.239 nm, respectively (Fig. 3f). In contrast, Pd/Mn-NiO exhibits a smaller and more uniform Pd particle size, averaging 4.87 ± 0.6 nm, suggesting that Mn doping effectively suppresses Pd crystal particle growth. The lattice stripes on the surface of Pd/Mn-NiO appear to be disordered. Besides the NiO (111) and (200) planes, the Mn2O3 (222) plane is also observed, with an interplanar spacing of about 0.18 nm (Fig. 3c). The doping of Mn ions, with ionic radii of 0.80 Å (Mn2+) and 0.66 Å (Mn3+), occupying Ni ion sites with ionic radii of 0.72 Å (Ni2+) and 0.62 Å (Ni3+), leads to lattice distortion and the formation of numerous oxygen vacancy defects, as indicated by red circles. Furthermore, the STEM-EDX images indicate that Pd is evenly dispersed on the surfaces of both catalysts. 3.3 Surface properties To ascertain the influence of surface composition and oxidation state on CH4 oxidation, XPS analysis was conducted on the catalysts, with the results depicted in Fig. 4 . The relative percentages of different valence states were determined from the peak area ratios of the XPS spectra and are presented in Table 1. In the XPS spectra of Pd 2d, peaks at approximately 337.1, 338.5, 342.5, and 346 eV were observed. The peaks at 337.1 eV (3d 5/2) and 342.5 eV (3d 3/2) are attributed to Pd2+ species, while those at 338.5 eV (3d 5/2) and 346 eV (3d 3/2) are characteristic of Pd4+ species, as detailed in the quantitative analysis (Table 1). The Pd/Mn-NiO catalyst exhibits a higher Pd2+/Pd4+ ratio compared to Pd/NiO, suggesting that the Mn-NiO surface facilitates the enrichment of Pd2+ species. Studies have indicated that Pd2+ species are more catalytically active in the oxidation of CH4 compared to metallic Pd [35]. The wide peaks at 529.5 eV of the XPS spectra of O 1 s correspond to lattice oxygen Olatt (O2−), and the wide peaks at 531 eV correspond to adsorbed oxygen Oads (O2 −, O−, or O2 2−) [36,37], which can be decomposed into H2O or adsorbed hydroxyl at 532.3 eV. As shown in Table 1, the Oads/Olatt ratio of Mn-NiO is higher than that of NiO, which is caused by the dissolution of the part of Mn3+ in NiO (i.e., Mn3++Ni3+→Mn4++Ni2+), which is accompanied by the generation of O−. It was noted that the Oads/Olatt ratios increased after Pd loading on Mn-NiO and NiO, indicating that the interface interaction between Pd ion and carrier can stimulate more surface electrophilic oxygen species. The spectra of Ni 2p 3/2 is divided into three characteristic peaks attributed to Ni3+, Ni2+, and satellite peaks at 855.9, 854.5, and 855.9 eV, respectively. The Ni3+/Ni2+ ratios of NiO and Mn-NiO are 2.56 and 2.61, respectively. The higher Ni3+ ratio of Mn-NiO is caused by the doping of Mn species to occupy the NiO lattice site. And more Ni2+ vacancies are produced, which provide sites for the transition of lattice oxygen. The Ni3+/Ni2+ ratio of Pd/NiO and Pd/Mn-NiO decreased to 2.31 and 2.35, respectively, which may be due to the transformation of Pd species during heat treatment, corresponding to the production of Pd4+ in Pd 3d The decreased Ni3+/Ni2+ ratio of Pd/Mn-NiO and Pd/NiO leads to an increase in their Oads/Olatt ratio, which means that the increase in Ni2+ due to Pd loading can form more oxygen vacancies and unsaturated chemical bonds. It is reported that the presence of Ni2+ is one of the reasons for promoting CH4 combustion catalysis [14]. It is noted that the Ni3+/Ni2+ ratio of Pd/Mn-NiO is slightly lower than that of Pd/NiO. Due to the strong oxidation of Mn ion, it can be inferred that some Pd species are oxidized by Mn ion, that is, electron transfer of Pd to Mn substance occurs. The results suggest that the introduction of Mn leads to different Pd-carrier interactions. The spectrum of Mn 2p 3/2 is divided into three characteristic peaks of Mn2+, Mn3+, and Mn4+ at 641.4, 642.7, and 644.6 eV, respectively [38]. The (Mn2++Mn3+) ratio of Pd/Mn-NiO and Mn-NiO are 0.78 and 0.68, respectively. The increase of Mn2+ ions in Pd/Mn-NiO is due to the reduction of Mn ions by Pd substances, which confirms the results of Ni 2p. 3.4 Reducibility and oxygen mobility The catalyst's reducibility was evaluated using H2-TPR, with the findings depicted in Fig. 5 a. Two distinct reduction peaks were noted for NiO; the minor peak at approximately 210 °C is indicative of the Ni3+ to Ni2+ reduction process [16]. The prominent peak at around 292 °C corresponds to the Ni2+ to Ni0 transformation [23]. In the case of Mn-NiO, three reduction peak regions were identified, with the significant peak at about 218 °C still corresponding to the Ni3+ to Ni2+ reduction. The XPS analysis suggests that Mn doping within the NiO lattice increases the Ni3+ concentration, thereby enhancing Mn-NiO's low-temperature reducibility. The peak observed at approximately 298 °C may represent a partial overlap of Ni2+→Ni0 and Mn4+→Mn3+, explaining the unique curve profile. A novel broad peak at around 413 °C on Mn-NiO is attributed to the sequential reduction of Mn3+→Mn2+→Mn0 [39]. Collectively, these results indicate that the incorporation of Mn species enhances reduction strength and broadens the temperature window for reduction. Furthermore, Pd/NiO exhibits a broad peak at 128 °C, a temperature at which only noble metals are reduced by H2 [40]. The literature suggests that this weak, broad peak may be due to the reduction of PdO or the reduction of adsorbed reactive oxygen species near the Pd-carrier interface [35]. Notably, Pd/Mn-NiO displays a strong reduction peak at 118 °C, with the shift to a lower temperature and increased H2 consumption suggesting that Mn incorporation facilitates reactive oxygen reduction at the Pd-carrier interface. This reduction is positively correlated with the concentration of oxygen vacancies, where reactive oxygen species can be adsorbed, activated, and subsequently participate in the oxidation of CH4. Additionally, the grain size is a pivotal factor influencing reducibility. According to the XRD data, both Mn doping and Pd loading decrease the catalyst's grain size, with smaller grain-sized catalysts generally being more readily reduced [41]. O2-TPD analysis was utilized to investigate the composition and mobility of oxygen within the catalyst, as illustrated in Fig. 5b. The O2-TPD profile can be divided into three temperature regions: 60–300 °C, 300–600 °C, and above 600 °C. The corresponding desorption peaks are attributed to surface reactive oxygen species O2 − (referred to as Oα), surface lattice oxygen O− (referred to as Oβ), and bulk lattice oxygen O2− (referred to as Oγ), respectively [35]. Both O2 − and O− are considered reactive oxygen species and are pivotal in the low-temperature oxidation of CH4. The ratio of (Oα+Oβ) to Oγ, determined through peak fitting of the three oxygen species, is presented in Table 1. Upon the incorporation of Pd into NiO, the (Oα+Oβ)/Oγ ratio is observed to decrease. This is evidenced by an increase in the release of O2 − from the bulk lattice at 682 °C, potentially due to the simultaneous release of O2 and the bulk lattice oxygen from PdO. Furthermore, the introduction of Mn into the NiO lattice results in a shift of the active oxygen O2 − desorption temperature on the catalyst surface to lower values, with a more pronounced release of oxygen from the high-temperature lattice. It is noteworthy that, in contrast to NiO, the (Oα+Oβ)/Oγ ratio for Pd-loaded Mn-NiO increased, and the regions of peak consumption for surface reactive oxygen species and surface lattice oxygen were broadened. According to Yang et al., the introduction of Mn at a high-active site produces Pd-□-Mn (□ denotes oxygen vacancy), which can activate more surface lattice oxygen and facilitate the migration of lattice oxygen [42]. It is concluded that the interfacial synergistic effect created by the loading of Pd species on the surface of Mn-NiO is more effective in generating reactive oxygen species and promoting their participation in the oxidation reaction. This enhancement in reactivity is beneficial for the overall catalytic process. 3.5 CH4 oxidation mechanism DRIFTS-MS was employed to examine the four catalysts under a CH4+O2 atmosphere, as depicted in Figs. 6 a-d. The MS signal diagrams and the DRIFTS spectral peak heights are provided in Fig. S5. The bands observed at 3650 and 1630 cm−1 are indicative of the consumption of hydroxyl groups and water, respectively [26]. Bands at 3020 and 1304 cm−1 correspond to the antisymmetric stretching vibration and the deformation vibration of the CH bonds in gaseous CH4, respectively [43,44]. On the catalyst surface, three detectable intermediates were identified. The bands in the range of 1560–1580 cm−1 are attributed to the stretching vibrations of formate ions (HCOO−) [39,45]. The band at 1370 cm−1 is associated with the stretching vibrations of carbonate ions (CO3 2−) [46]. The bands within the range of 1140–1260 cm−1 are indicative of the stretching vibrations of bridging carbonate species [16]. In addition to the detection of carbonate intermediates, the consumption of surface oxygen species was also noted. The band at 1290 cm−1 is characteristic of surface adsorbed oxygen species, represented as M = O, and the band at 750 cm−1 is indicative of the consumption of surface lattice oxygen species, denoted as M-O-M [47]. These findings provide insights into the surface reactions and intermediates formed during the catalytic process, which are crucial for understanding the underlying mechanisms of the catalytic oxidation of CH4. In DRIFTS analysis, the accumulation of formates and carbonates on the surface of the four catalysts was observed. The normalized peak height data (as shown in Fig. S4) indicate a formate formation rate in the temperature range of 200 °C to 500 °C that follows the order: Pd/Mn-NiO > Pd/NiO > Mn-NiO > NiO. For carbonate formation, the rate is: Mn-NiO > NiO > Pd/Mn-NiO > Pd/NiO. The findings suggest that the incorporation of Pd enhances the accumulation of formate, which is one of the detectable intermediate in the oxidation of CH4. Formate can be further oxidized into carbonate or CO2. On the Pd/Mn-NiO surface, the consumption of M = O and M-O-M changes most markedly with temperature. In conjunction with the O2-TPD results, the synergistic effect at the interface between Pd and Mn-NiO is shown to promote the migration of surface oxygen O−. It is inferred that during CH4 combustion, the lattice oxygen transition ability of NiO and Mn-NiO is relatively weak, and formate is not readily oxidized to carbonate, which results in lower activity and selectivity. The substantial consumption of M-O-M on Pd/Mn-NiO indicates that the strong migration capability of surface lattice oxygen in the CH4 reaction facilitates the exchange cycle of oxygen atoms, accelerates the rate of formate accumulation, and enhances the reaction. At temperatures rising to 200 °C, a significant accumulation of bridge carbonate on the NiO surface can be easily observed at 1140–1260 cm−1, with a noticeable decrease in band intensity after Pd loading. It is noteworthy that the peak strength of the surface bridging carbonate on Mn-NiO is diminished, and the spectrum band of surface bridging carbonate on Pd/Mn-NiO almost vanishes. This confirms that Mn incorporation generates a large number of oxygen vacancies, and these surface defects provide sites for the adsorption and dissociation of gaseous oxygen, thereby increasing the decomposition rate of bridging carbonate. The mechanism for the CH4 oxidation over the Pd/Mn-NiO catalyst is delineated in Fig. 7 , and it aligns with the MvK mechanism. Given the substantial enrichment of Pd2+ on the surface of Pd-modified Mn-NiO as confirmed by XPS, and the consequent improvement in catalytic activity, Pd2+ can be identified as the active center. The process begins with the adsorption and dissociation of CH4 on Pd2+ sites, characterized by the cleavage of the CH bond. The resulting CH3 species can then undergo further oxidation to form formates and carbonate intermediates, which eventually decompose into CO2. Formates are produced through the interaction between the dissociated CH4 species (CH3) and the surface oxygen species (M-O2, M = O, M-O-M). They can react with more surface oxygen species to form carbonates. Eventually, the carbonates gasify into CO2 and H2O [48,49]. 4 Conclusion This study presented the development of a high-performance catalyst for the oxidation of CH4 by integrating Pd nanoparticles onto Mn-doped NiO. This catalyst has significantly bolstered the capabilities for low-temperature CH4 oxidation. Here is a refined summary of the key experimental outcomes: (1) The Pd/Mn-NiO catalyst exhibited unparalleled activity for CH4 oxidation, achieving the lowest T50 temperature of 275 °C, surpassing Pd/NiO (304 °C), Mn-NiO (336 °C), and NiO (445 °C). Moreover, Pd/Mn-NiO reached a remarkable CH4 conversion of 97% at 325 °C, coupled with excellent thermal stability. (2) The Ea value for CH4 oxidation over Pd/Mn-NiO is the lowest at 69.2 kJ mol–1, suggesting a more facile pathway for the oxidation process. (3) The doping of Mn into NiO has induced beneficial lattice distortions and a reduction in average grain size, likely contributing to the enhanced catalytic performance. (4) Pd/Mn-NiO demonstrated an elevated Pd2+/Pd4+ ratio and Oads/Olatt ratio, alongside a diminished Ni3+/Ni2+ ratio, which work in concert to augment CH4 oxidation. (5) The interplay between Pd and Mn-NiO is identified as a pivotal factor that fosters the migration of surface lattice oxygen, thereby facilitating the conversion of formates to carbonates and CO2. (6) The CH4 oxidation mechanism over Pd/Mn-NiO adheres to the MvK mechanism, with Pd2+ identified as the active site for CH4 adsorption and dissociation. DRIFTS-MS analysis has delineated the pathway of surface reactive oxygen species in the formation of intermediates such as formates. It also confirms that the Pd-modified surface on Mn-NiO accelerates the decomposition of carbonate. In summary, this study highlights the Pd/Mn-NiO catalyst as a formidable contender for CH4 oxidation, with its performance gains attributed to a synergistic blend of structural optimizations, heightened surface reactivity, and the catalytically enriching interaction between Pd and Mn-NiO. These discoveries are instrumental for the progression of catalyst technologies aimed at environmental and energy applications, particularly in addressing CH4 emission challenges.

        "dc:description": "This study introduces a novel catalyst system comprising Pd nanoparticles loaded onto Mn-doped NiO for the efficient oxidation of methane (CH4) at low temperatures. The loading of Pd nanoparticles onto the Mn-doped support has yielded a catalyst with exceptional activity and stability, as evidenced by the lowest T50 temperature of 276 °C and a CH4 conversion reaching 97% at 325 °C. The catalyst demonstrates optimized reaction kinetics with the lowest activation energy of 69.2 kJ mol–1. The catalyst's superior performance is attributed to the synergistic effects of the Pd/Mn-NiO composite, which include a higher Pd2+/Pd4+ ratio, increased adsorptive oxygen concentration (Oads/Ototal), and a reduced Ni3+/Ni2+ ratio. These characteristics collectively enhance the catalytic activity for CH4 oxidation. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism underpins the oxidation process, with Pd2+ identified as the principal active site for CH4 adsorption and dissociation. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy coupled with mass spectrometry elucidates the pathway of surface reactive oxygen species in the formation of key intermediates, such as formates, and underscores the accelerated decomposition of carbonate facilitated by the Pd modification on the Mn-NiO surface. The findings signify a significant advancement in the development of catalysts for environmental and energy-related applications, particularly in the mitigation of CH4 emissions.",
