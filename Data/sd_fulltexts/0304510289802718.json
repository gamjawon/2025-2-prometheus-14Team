The differences between the surface properties of the fixed catalyst and conventional impregnation catalysts are discussed. The catalytic activity of the mixed P^Mo^ catalyst has been evaluated in the epoxidation of cyclohexene relative to the behaviour of conventional Mo^ homogeneous catalysts or B^Mo^ catalysts heterogenized using the same procedure. Introduction Selective epoxidation of olefins by alkyl hydroperoxides catalyzed by d0 metal complexes such as Mo^, Vv or Ti^ has become a most import- ant industrial process for the manufacture of propylene oxide due to the recent utilization of a t-butyl alcohol coproduct as an octane booster in gasoline [1]. Numerous attempts have been made to heterogenize the conventional molybdenum catalyst. The classical impregnation method followed by calci- nation for catalyst activation has been applied extensively using inorganic acids or salts such as ammonium paramolybdate. However, in aqueous solution, oxymolybdenic species such as between (Mo04)2- and (Mo^Oy)\"\" are in equilibrium depending on the the pH, temperature and concentration of the solution [2]. Consequently a non-uniform distribution of active sites on 0304-5102/89/$3.50 Eisevier Sequoia/Printed m The Netherlands 372 the catalyst surface may be produced during immersion and calcination, and conflicting results may sometimes be drawn. In order to avoid these drawbacks, we decided [3] to heterogenize conventional molybdenum catalysts molecularly using a suitably functional- ized polymeric support (e.g. with surface boronic acid moieties) and con- trolling the Mo-fixation process through acid-base interaction accompanied by water elimination between molybdic acid and the surface boronic acid groups as follows: 0 -, 0 II II B-OH + HO-Mo-OH - +B-c)-Mo\"\"OM + H 0 (1 ; i il J i il ' 2 nu 0 - OH 0 (I) (1) OH The same Mo-fixing process has now been investigated further using a macroporous resin produced by Rohm & Haas (Duolite C 467) whose polystyrene matrix crosslinked with divinylbenzene moieties contains aminophosphonic acid groups such as (II): R-CH,NH-CHgP-0-Na 0-Na (II) In a similar manner to previous studies the mixed P^'-M.d\"1 oxo deriva- tives obtained have been investigated kinetically in order to specifically evaluate the possible effects induced by phosphorus in terms of the modifica- tion of the electronic requirements of the Mo-centre for hydroperoxide activation and oxygen transfer to olefins. Experimental Catalyst preparation In agreement with earlier findings [4] we have found that the optimum conditions for Mo^ fixation exist over the pH range 1.0 - 3.0. In a more acidic environment molybdic acid fixation is partially inhibited by protonation of the phosphonic groups, whereas in a more alkaline medium the fraction of anionic oxymolybdenic species increases substantially. In comparison to the grafting procedures adopted by Filippov et al., who fixed Mo^ on to cellulose phosphate [5], we have observed the following distinctive features: (1) It was necessary to swell the regenerated resin (II) in dioxan prior to use. 373 (2) The grafting procedure could be carried out conveniently in il^OI dioxan (35/65, v/v). (3) Removal of water by azeotropic distillation could be performed in vacua at fairly moderate temperatures (T < 85 C) in the presence of traces of H,0,. (4) The grafted catalyst had to be thoroughly washed (water, dioxan and diethyl ether) before drying in vacua. (5) The P/Mo ratio as determined by atomic absorption after prelimi- nary chemical attack and solubilization of the grafted sample was generally greater than unity (1.2 <P/Mo < 1.7; initial P concentration 11.7% w/w). With the grafted catalysts (I), the B/Mo ratio was equal to 1. Under the experimental conditions reported above, the prerequisite of electroneutrality leads to the assumption that fixation of Mo^ on the regenerated resin (II) generates a fully protonated species (III) or its corre- sponding salt form (IV): 1 ow. +P-0-M3-OM J i ii ^ OH 0 UH^ (III) 1 ? ^ +P-0-MS-0' Na* J l \"\\, OH 0 OH (IV) We favour structure (III) on the basis of combined morphological, ther- mogravimetric and IR analyses performed on the regenerated resin (II) before and after Mo^ fixation. Indeed, we have found that some modifications which affect the unsupported resin (II) such as the self-condensation of phosphonic acid groups: o o -P-OH + HO-P- OH OH p-o-p - OH OH t^ (2) may be helpfully used to assess water elimination between molybdic acid and surface phosphonic acid groups: 1 ? ? 1 ? c (3) -P-OH + HO-Mo-OH hP-0-Mo-OH + HJD i OH '0 J OH (3 374 Results Morphological analysis [6] Figure 1 depicts scanning electron micrographs of resin (II) at various stages in the experiments. These show that the almost perfectly spherical particles of the starting resin are not affected when Mo^ fixation is carried out. These observations are confirmed by the results listed in Table 1. These results were obtained using an image analyzer (Optomax V) coupled with an optical microscope (Nikon Measurescope). The minor modifications found may be attributed to the grafting procedure which involves acid treatment of Fig. l. SEM micrographs of resin (II): initially (a, b), after regeneration (c, d) and after Mo-fixation (e, f). 375 TABLE 1 Area measurements of resin (II) After regeneration After Mo-fixation Average area (mm2) 0.1705 Minimum area (mm2) 0.0892 Maximum area (mm2) 0.3453 0.0442 0.0304 0.0567 the slurry in aqueous dioxan, and could be due to a minimal collapse of the NH bonds of the polymeric backbone of resin (II). The BET surface area (Carlo Erba Sorptomatic) calculated for resin (II), either regenerated or Mo-grafted, was low (12m2 g\"1). Thermogravimetric and IR analyses [7] Under an inert atmosphere and over the range from room temperature to 350 C, the thermal treatment of unsupported and regenerated resin (II) has been carefully monitored by observing the decrease in intensity of two typical bands chosen by reference to the IR data for inorganic phosphorus compounds [8], i.e. PO H stretching which gives rise to a band at 3430 cm\"1 and PO H bending at 910 cm\"1. The observed PO H stretching is about 200 - 300 cm\"1 lower than the normal vibrational mode for HaO (3756 cm\"1 for V3 and 3653 cm\"1 for Vi) in C^ symmetry [9], thus suggesting the presence of intermolecularly hydrogen-bonded phosphonic acid groups. Monitoring the decrease in intensity of the bands reported above makes it difficult to evaluate the quantity of water definitely removed from the PO H functional group. However, the results obtained seem to indicate two stages of water elimination. The first stage corresponds to elimination of small amounts of weakly bound water, while the second stage up to 350 C involves the condensation of phosphonic acid groups as depicted by eqn. (2). In fact, in line with the observed decrease in the intensities of the bands corresponding to the PO H stretching and bending vibrations, a new band is observed at 1020 cm\" t (P 0 P stretching vibration) whose intensity increases with increasing temperature. The corresponding P 0 P bending vibration (at ca. 750 cm\" t) could not be observed due to interference arising from the presence of starting material. These observations agree fairly well with those obtained by Segawa et al. [10] in an investigation of the dehydration of amorphous zirconium phosphate gel. On examination of the regenerated resin (II) after Mo^ fixation, addi- tional evidence is obtained since a strong band now emerges at 750cm\"1 while the PO H bending vibration at 910cm\"1 appears as a doublet at 910-950cm\"1. The observed doublet lies in the region where the stretching vibrations of the molybdenum-oxygen bond of either the tetrahedral or octahedral oxomolybdenum(6+) species is generally assigned [3]. It is thus 376 reasonable to assume that the grafting procedure affects the phosphonic acid group in the manner suggested in eqn. (3) above. With the Mo-grafted resin (III), increasing the temperature up to 250 C under an inert atmosphere leads to no striking differences being observed in terms of weight loss relative to the unsupported resin. The fact that molybde- num appears to have no influence on the degradation pattern under an inert atmosphere, coupled with the observed shift to a markedly lower degradation temperature when the inert atmosphere of N3 is substituted by air, strongly suggests that Mo64^ has a specific catalytic role in the degradation of the lattice. Catalytic activities The specific catalytic activities of the grafted catalysts have been investigated in the epoxidation of cyclohexene with t-butyl or ethylbenzene hydroperoxide. In agreement with recent findings obtained with homoge- neous catalysts [II], an adequate description of the kinetic data may be obtained by assuming that the time dependence of the kinetic coefficients is due to the decreased activity arising from substantial deactivation of the catalyst during the latter stages of the reaction. Rather than employing the complex reaction pattern devised by Filip- pov et al. [12], we have treated the experimental data using our modified Michaelis-Menten type model equation [11]. Table 2 reports the kinetic parameters obtained, where Kg is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the catalyst-hydroperoxide com- plex while ^i,ai> ^i,ep a1\"! ^i,ai> ^i, ep are the direct rate constants and equilibrium constants for the formation of the inhibiting complexes between the catalyst and the alcohol and epoxide, respectively.

''See ref. 11. 'See ref. 3. 377 Discussion By using essentially the same Mo-fixing process, we have been able to heterogenize homogeneous Mo^ derivatives on polymeric supports func- tionalized with B OH or P OH acid groups. On the basis of the results obtained so far, we have found that the chemical nature of the polymeric acid pendant group affects the coordinating ability of the molybdenum centre differently. From a synthetic point of view and relative to our newly reported heterogenized boron(III)-molybdenum(VI) mixed oxo derivatives (I) [3], it should be observed that when phosphonic rather than boronic acid groups are involved in the Mo-fixation step, milder experimental conditions must necessarily be adopted, at least when resin (II) is used as a support. In addition, it is known that phosphonic acids are stronger than boronic acids; accordingly their interaction with molybdic acid as indicated in eqn. (3) is less favoured. Thus when comparing the ratios of functional groups in the grafted catalysts, it is not surprising to find that P/Mo is greater than B/Mo; this necessarily affects the catalytic activities of resins (I) and (III). As regards the data reported in Table 2, it may be observed that relative to conventional homogeneous catalysts such as Mo02(acac)2, the grafting procedure employed with catalysts (I) and (III) does not adversely affect the electrophilicity (Lewis acid character) of the molybdenum centre since the same model equation can be used in both cases. Nevertheless, when compar- ing the kinetic parameters of the two differently functionalized Mo-grafted catalysts, it is observed that a lower rate constant is obtained in the latter case. By the same token, using (III) rather than (I) leads to a higher rate constant for the formation of the inhibiting complex between the catalyst and the epoxide (A; gp), while the corresponding equilibrium constant for the formation of the inhibiting complex between the catalyst and the epoxide (K, p) is lower. MeL-ROH'epox MeLRq,H -MeLRO^H ol Scheme 1. 378 These kinetic results may be explained by emphasizing the differences induced by boron or phosphorus on the vicinal molybdenum coordinating centre. However it should also be borne in mind that the presence of free (non-Mo-grafted) phosphonic pendant groups in the proximity of the coordi- nating molybdenum centre would necessarily imply [3] a higher interaction between the free acid site and the reaction products (epoxide and alcohol), and thus a slower pattern of regeneration for the active d metal alkylperox- idic intermediate MeL ROgH (see Scheme 1) Additional investigations are in progress to further elucidate the mech- anistic aspects of these results.
