Panster Degussa AG, Postfach 1345, Rodenbacher Chaussee 4, D-6450 Hanau 1 (Germany) (Received July 30, 1992; accepted October 26, 1992 ) Abstract Selective hydrogenations of different a,/3-unsaturated aldehydes into allylic alcohols with immobilized homogeneous catalysts are reported. Different kinds of catalysts were used: supported aqueous-phase catalysts (RuCl2(TPPTS)3/Si02 and RuH2(TPPTS)4/Si02) and supported homogeneous catalysts (especially phosphino-iridium catalysts like IrCl3{(C,HS)P[(CHZ)3S103/2]2 2N[ (CH2)3Si03/2]3-2Si02}3). Some of them are good alternatives to homogeneous catalysts since they are chemoselective, sometimes stereoselective and easy to recover. Key words: hydrogenation; iridium; ruthenium; supported catalyst; a, fl-unsaturated aldehydes Introduction a,ss-Unsaturated aldehydes constitute important intermediates in the field of flavor and fragrance chemistry [ 1 ] . Very often, the synthesis of new products involves selective reduction of the carbonyl function. Catalytic and selective hydrogenation of a,/3-unsaturated aldehydes to allylic alcohols is an attractive way to carry out the reduction with respect to economical and industrial process considerations. In previous papers, we have presented efficient homogeneous catalysts for this kind of hydrogenation [ 2 ] . In the case of aldehydes with short carbon chains (3-methyl-2-butenal for instance), the catalyst recycling problem, main drawback of homogeneous catalysis, has been overcome by the use of ruthenium complexes with sulfonated phosphines, especially tris (m-sulfophenyl)-phosphine trisodium salt (TPPTS). Numerous applications of this ligand, in the field of homogeneous catalysis, have been reported, such as hydrocyanation of alkenes [3], telo- *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 0304-5102/93/$06.00 1993 - Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

Catal. 79 (1993) 117-131 merisation of dienes [4], hydroformylation of alkenes [5], 1,4-addition of active methylene derivatives to conjugated dienes [6] and hydrogenation of aldehydes [7]. Among them, hydroformylation (Ruhrchemie/Rhone-Poulenc process) and nucleophilic addition to 1,3-dienes (Rhone-Poulenc Animal Nutrition [8] ), both catalyzed by Rh/TPPTS, have become industrial processes. However, in the case of aldehydes with long carbon chains, the use of a liquidliquid biphasic system, where the reactants are in an organic phase and the catalyst in water, leads to poor results, probably because of the low solubility of the reactants in water. For instance, the chemoselective and stereoselective hydrogenation of hydroquinone all-trans-retinal complex 1 (RHQ) to all-transretinol, an important reaction in vitamin A synthesis [9,10] has been efficiently achieved with RuH2 (PPh3) 4 in methanol whilst poor results were obtained in a biphasic system with RuH2 (TPPTS) 4 [ 2a ] . In order to overcome the problem mentioned, we have studied the chemoselective hydrogenation of different aldehydes (3-methyl-2-butenal, alltrans-retinal 2 and RHQ 1) into allylic alcohols with two kinds of catalyst: (i) supported aqueous-phase catalysts, similar to Rh catalysts recently developed for hydroformylation of long chain alkenes [ 11 ] and (ii) commercial supported homogeneous catalysts [ 12 ] . Experimental Materials RuC13 - 3H20 was purchased from Strem Chemicals. Other ruthenium complexes, including TPPTS-ruthenium compounds, were prepared by conventional methods [7,13,14]. TPPTS was synthesized by sulfonation of PPh3 [ 3 ] . Silica gel (Merck 60 H) was supplied by Merck. Pure samples of all-transretinal were purchased from Aldrich. The all-trans-retinal hydroquinone complex (1) (RHQ) was obtained according to a published procedure (9b) . Other reagents or products were commercially available or supplied by Rhone-Poulenc Animal Nutrition (RPAN). Argon and hydrogen were used as received, without purification. All organic solvents were purified by standard techniques and stored under argon. All reactions were carried out in an inert atmosphere using standard methods. Catalysts Ru-supported aqueous phase catalysts They were synthesized by analogy with the synthesis of Rh supported aqueous-phase catalysts [ 11 ] . In a typical synthesis, 8.8 g of silica gel (Merck 60 H) are degassed under vacuum (0.1 mmHg) at room temperature. After one hour, vacuum is replaced by argon and a solution of Ru-TPPTS complex, (RuCl2 (TPPTS )3 or RuH2 (TPPTS )4; 0.18 mmol of Ru dissolved in 50 cm' of degassed water) is added to silica gel. The orange suspension is stirred for 3 h E. Fache et al./J. Mol. Catal. 79 (1993) 117-131 119 at room temperature. Water is then eliminated under vacuum (0.1 mmHg) at 25 C and the brown-yellow solid obtained, is dried under vacuum at 25 C for 8 h and then stored in a glove box. For RuCl2(TPPTS)3/Si02 (I) C=1.2; P=0.15%. For RuH2(TPPTS)4/Si02 (II) C=1.6; P=0.20%. Supported homogeneous catalysts These catalysts were manufactured and supplied by Degussa [ 12 ] . They were synthesized according to a method for which there is a European patent application [ 12c ] . For instance, the catalyst Ir 5 % (RG 441) was made by the following procedure: In a 3 1 glass vessel equipped with double-jacket heating, KPG agitator and reflux cooler, 22.26 g (63.2 mmol) IrC13-3H20 was dissolved in 500 ml ethanol under argon at 60 C. The clear solution was, first, treated with 82.4 g (189.5 mmol) (C6Hs) P [ (CH2) 3S1(OCH3) 3 ] 2 and after 5 min, with 39.5 g (189.5 mmol) Si (OC2H5) 4 and subsequently agitated for 1 h at reflux temperature. Then, an additional 39.5 g Si(OC2H5)4, 238.8 g (379.0 mmol) N [ CH2) 3S1(OC2H5) 3 ] 3 and 130 ml water were added. After 10 min of further agitation at reflux temperature, the solution was cooled down to 70'C and stirred at this temperature at 100 rpm until the onset of gelling. Immediately after this, 700 ml octan-1-of heated to 60 C was added to the gel forming and the stirring speed was raised to 750 rpm. After a further minute of homogenizing, 1200 ml water in which 1.2 g polyvinyl alcohol (available under the trademark Moviol) had been dissolved was added to the viscous solution. The twophase system was heated to reflux temperature and stirred for an additional two hours at this temperature. After the system had cooled, the solid, present as small yellow spheres, and the mother solution were separated by decanting, and the solvent-moist solid and mother solution were each divided into two equal parts. Half of the solid, as well as half the amount of mother solution, were transferred to a 5 liter autoclave (for further processing of the other half, see example 7 in ref. 12c) and agitated under stirring at a temperature of 135 C for a period of 48 h under inherent pressure. The mixture was cooled, the liquid phase removed TABLE 1 Characterization of the yellow spheres Elemental analysis (% ) Ir P H C Cl Si Calculated 5.78 2.79 4.8 32.5 3.2 25.3 Observed 5.70 2.68 4.7 31.7 3.1 24.8 Bulk density: 230 g 1-1 Specific surface: 540 m2 g-1 Pore volume (pore diameter > 2 nm): 5.4 ml g-1 Formula of polymer unit: IrCl3{ (C6H5)P [ (CH2 )gSiO3/2 ] Z- 2N [ (CHZ )3S103/2 ]3 2Si02}3 120 E.

The solid was then dried for 12 h at 100 C and for an additional 12 h at 130 C under an atmosphere of N2.103 g (98% of calculated yield) of product was obtained, of which over 98% was present as yellow spheres with a sphere diameter of 50 ,Cm to 0.6 mm. Salient features are listed in Table 1. Products analysis The products of the hydrogenation of 3-methyl-2-butenal were identified by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Gas chromatography was run on a Varian 3700 instrument equipped with a Reoplex 400 Chromosorb PAW packed column. The peaks were identified by comparison with authentic samples and GC-MS techniques. The gas chromatograph was calibrated to calculate concentrations of products on a mol percent basis. The products of the hydrogenation of all-traps-retinal 2 or all-traps-retinal hydroquinone complex 1 (RHQ) were separated by HPLC and identified by comparison with authentic samples and mass spectrometry. HPLC was performed on an Si 60 (5 ,um) Lichrosorb column (115 X 4 mm) using hexaneethyl acetate (90/10 v/v) as eluant (1 ml min') with a Shimadzu 231 liquid chromatograph, equipped with a UV detector (A,=325 nm). Hydrogenation procedure A typical run was carried out in a glass-lined stainless steel autoclave which was agitated by rocking (200 cycles/min). Catalyst, aldehyde and the desired organic solvent were successively introduced, under an inert atmosphere, into the ampoule, which then was placed in the autoclave. The reactor was purged three times with hydrogen, before setting the required hydrogen pressure. During the run, the hydrogen pressure was kept constant by continuously feeding from a high pressure reservoir. As the reaction proceeded, the decline of the hydrogen pressure within the reservoir was recorded. At the end of the uptake, the autoclave was cooled and vented carefully. The suspension was filtered under argon. The filtrate was analyzed by chromatography. The catalyst was washed with small portions of the appropriate solvent and then dried under vacuum (0.1 mmHg; 25 C) before being recovered and used again in a new hydrogenation reaction. Results and discussion Supported aqueous-phase catalysis Ru-TPPTS complexes have proved to be efficient homogeneous catalysts for the hydrogenation of aldehydes [ 7 ] and a,ss-unsaturated aldehydes [ 2b ] . An easy way to immobilize them has recently been described [ 11 ] . Hence, we have synthesized two supported aqueous-phase catalysts: RUC12(TPPTS)3/ Si02 I and RuH2 (TPPTS) 4/Si02 II by the general scheme: E. Fache et al./J. Mol. Catal. 79 (1993)117-131 121 Si02 + Ru L H20 P- catsYst L = P 3 . x H20 (TpPTS) \\S03 Na 3 It is believed that the immobilization is due to strong interactions between the sulfonated groups of the phosphine and the silanol groups of the silica inside a surface water film. Hydrogenation of 3-methyl-2-butenal (prenal) in hexane Supported aqueous-phase catalysts have been previously used usually in non-polar media [ 11 ] . We have confirmed that I and II were able to hydrogenate prenal in hexane (Table 2 ). While homogeneous Ru-TPPTS complexes, such as RuH2 (TPPTS) 4, were inactive in hexane because of their insolubility in the medium, I and II hydrogenated the aldehyde. This result is probably correlated with the high contact surface between liquid phase and the catalyst (specific surface of silica gel 350-450 m2 g-1). However, II showed better selectivity in 3-methyl-2-butenol (prenol) than I. At 100 C, I even gave 3-methyl-butanol with 75% selectivity, but at conversions of less than 100%, selectivity in allylic alcohol was higher (Table 3). Moreover, with I, the sum of the yields of the hydrogenation products was often lower than the conversion (Table 3 entry 10 for instance). This poor selectivity is probably due to the generation of hydrides from RuC12(TPPTS)3, under hydrogen, which yields hydrochloric acid. Recycling of I and II in hexane The immobilization of the catalysts offers advantages in product isolation and catalyst recycling. Indeed, the catalyst could be recycled for another run after simple filtration under an inert atmosphere. Table 3 displays the results obtained after several consecutive runs with I and II in hexane.

However, the deactivation appeared slower for II than I. For I, the previous observations have been made at two different temperatures (50 and 100 C). This decrease of activity could not be explained as metal dissolution, since, in all cases, we recovered from the filtrate less than 0.02% of the metal initially used. However, the carbon percentage on the catalysts strongly increased after hydrogenation (Table 4). Moreover, IR spectroscopy of I and II, before and after recycling, showed the appearance of bands due to prenal and prenol. All E. Fache et al./J. Mol. Catal. 79 (1993)117-131 123 these findings suggest poisoning by the reactants and products by adsorption on to the catalyst. Hydrogenation of 3-methyl-2-butenal in other solvents In order to estimate the potential of these catalysts in polar media, we decided to examine the hydrogenation of prenal with II without solvent and in methanol. When the aldehyde was used as reactant and solvent, the selectivity of the hydrogenation towards prenol was unchanged, compared with the case where hexane was the solvent. However, the decrease of activity during the recycling was faster (Table 5). Like for the diluted media, we cannot explain the phenomenon as the dissolution of the metal in prenal (less than 0.1 % of the metal used was recovered from the prenal). Here again, adsorption of the organic compounds seems to poison the catalyst; the carbon percentage before hydrogenation-1.2%, after recycling= 7.2%. When the hydrogenation was carried out in methanol, we observed a lower TABLE 5 Hydrogenation of 3-methyl-2-butenal without solvent recycling II Rune Yield and selectivity ( % ) 3-Methyl-2-butenol 3-Methyl butanal 3-Methyl butanol 1 15.8 90.8 1.0 5.7 0.6 3.4 2 5.0 90.9 0.4 7.3 0.1 1.8 3 1.5 89.3 0.1 8.3 0.04 2.4 4 < 0.5 - - - - - 'Conditions: Ru=1.8X 10-5 mol; 3-methyl-2-butenal=4.4 g (52 mmol); 100 bar H2; 50 C; 3 h.

The high percentage of metal recovered in solution, suggested that the dissolution of the metal was the reason for the deactivation in polar media (Table 6). Thus, the concept of supported aqueous-phase catalysis seems to be limited to non-polar media, probably because the strength of the interaction of the hydrophilic phosphine with the silanols decreases in a polar solvent. Moreover, the catalytic activity of supported aqueous-phase catalysts is generally sensitive to water content [ 11]. Although this parameter has not been measured, it is possible that the water film on the catalyst surface, is destroyed in a protic polar solvent, such as methanol. Hydrogenation of retinal 2 Catalyst II was able to hydrogenate 2 to retinol 3 with high selectivity in hexane and methanol (Table 7) . We encountered the same problems to recycle the catalyst as those met in the hydrogenation of prenal (rapid deactivation of catalyst).

E. Fache et al./J. Mol. Catal. 79 (1993) 117-131 125 Supported homogeneous catalysis Another usual way to immobilize a homogeneous catalyst is to support it on an organic or mineral support [ 15 ] . The latter supports are often preferred, because of their good mechanical properties. A wide variety of reactions have been carried out with such catalysts: hydrosilylation of alkenes [ 16 ] , hydroformylation of alkenes [ 17 ] , oligomerization of alkenes [ 18 ] , hydrogenation of alkenes [ 17',19 ] and, even, hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde with Rh supported catalyst [ 20 ] . However, allylic alcohol selectivity is poor. Since we developed efficient homogeneous catalysts to hydrogenate selectively a,ss-unsaturated aldehydes to allylic alcohols, and since Degussa has much know-how in the field of supported homogeneous catalysts [ 12 ] , we decided to work together to develop a new class of supported catalysts which would be: (i) chemoselective (selective hydrogenation of a, fss-unsaturated aldehydes to allylic alcohols), (ii) easily recovered and (iii) stereoselective in the case of the hydrogenation of all-traps retinal or RHQ (no loss of the trans stereochemistry). Hydrogenation of RHQ 1 Because of previous work in homogeneous catalysis [2], we initially decided to test the supported homogeneous catalysts based on hydrido-phosphine ruthenium complexes. Surprisingly, these catalysts, while chemoselective, presented poor activity and did not allow the stereochemistry to be retained. By contrast, supported catalysts based on phosphino-iridium complexes, gave the best results in terms of activity, chemoselectivity and stereoselectivity when the reaction was carried out at 50 and 100 bar (Table 8). In homogeneous catalysis, iridium complexes are already known to promote the selective carbonyl reduction of unsaturated aldehydes [ 21 ] . However, in the case of the hydrogenation of 3-methyl-2-butenal in homogeneous catalysis, iridium compounds showed lower activity than ruthenium complexes [ 2b ]. This behaviour has been attributed to the formation of inactive polynuclear TABLE 8 Hydrogenation of RHQ with supported homogeneous catalysts' Catalysts Conversion (%) Yields Selectivity (% ) (% )b Ir 5% (RG 415-1) 100 95.2 97.5 Ir 5% (RG 415-2) 99.2 94.5 90.5 Ir 5% (RG 415-3) 100 97.1 94.7 Ru 1% (RG 388) 60.5 58 75.3 Ru 1% (RG 405) 31 25.7 85.8 Ru 3.2% (RG 416-3) 43.4 40.4 79.9 'Conditions: metal=7.5X10-5 mol; RHQ=3X10-3 mol; EtOH 95%=50 ml; 100 bar H2; 50 C; 3.5 h.

Of course, immobilization of iridium compounds prevents cluster formation and could explain the good results obtained with supported homogeneous catalysts based on iridium. With the best iridium catalysts, the reaction could be carried out at room temperature (Table 9). Moreover, chemoselectivity and stereoselectivity appeared to be independent of conversion. Hydrogenation of other a, f3-unsaturated aldehydes The previous Ir-based catalysts were also able to hydrogenate chemoselectively all-traps-retinal and 3-methyl-2-butenal into allylic alcohols (Table 10 ). However, while no product corresponding to the C=C bond hydrogenation was observed with RHQ and all-traps-retinal - compounds different from retinol obtained during the hydrogenation of all-traps-retinal or RHQ were anhydro-vitamin A 4 and dimethyl acetal 5 - up to 10% of of 3-methyl-butanol were formed during the hydrogenation of prenal. The explanation of the difference of selectivity observed between retinal and 3-methyl-2-butenal, is not clear. However, because of the different sizes of the two molecules, it is possible E.

Catalyst recycling The immobilization of the metal allowed an easy recovery of the catalyst by filtration. In the case of prenal and all-traps-retinal, the catalyst kept its initial activity during five consecutive runs (Table 11). These results were in agreement with the fact that no metal was recovered from the filtrate (<_ 0.1 % of the metal used). Moreover, with all-traps-retinal, the catalyst stayed chemoand stereo-selective during the recycling.

Figures 1 and 2 show the differing types of behaviour of the catalyst when the substrate was all-trans-retinal or RHQ. While no decrease of activity was observed with retinal, there was a steady decrease with RHQ. In the two cases, the catalyst stayed chemo- and stereo-selective (all- trans-retinol/1retinol>_95% ).

However, addition of free hydroquinone to all-traps-retinal did not inhibit the activity of the catalyst during the recycling. A 100% conversion during five consecutive runs was achieved, while 0.5 equiv. of free hydroquinone (versus all-traps-retinal) was added at each run (retinal= 3 mmol; Ir = 7.5 X 10- 5 mol; EtOH 95 % = 50 ml; PH2 =100 bar; 25 C; 3.5 h). Since the RHQ used contained up to 1000 ppm (w/w) of iodine, we added12to the reaction medium. Then we did observe a regular decrease of catalyst activity similar to what had been observed with RHQ (Table 12 ). HI gives the same result. So, we have demonstrated that iodine was the poison for the iridium catalyst used and that the recycling of the catalyst was possible when this was avoided. Comparison with homogeneous catalyst Having found a supported homogeneous catalyst which was (i) chemoselective, (ii) stereoselective (stereoselectivity in the sense that there was no loss of the initial stereochemistry), (iii) easily recovered, we wished to compare the results obtained with this catalyst with the performance of the best homogeneous catalysts found, RuH2(PPh3)4 (Table 13). Whilst the conditions of the reaction were different, it was clear that the supported catalyst was less active than the homogeneous one. Our future aim is to improve the activity of the supported catalyst. 130 E. Fache et al./J. Mol.

Conclusion In order to overcome the main drawback of homogeneous catalysis, the catalyst recycling, we have examined two ways of immobilizing efficient homogeneous catalysts for the hydrogenation of a,ss-unsaturated aldehydes into allylic alcohols. The supported aqueous-phase catalysts, RuC12(TPPTS)3/Si02 (I) and RUH2(TPPTS)4/Si02 (II) present some advantages: (i) they are easy to synthesize (ii) their ability to conserve the properties, especially chemoselectivity, of the corresponding homogeneous catalysts. However, they have great drawbacks: (i) their use seems limited to non-polar solvents, since in polar media such as methanol, we have observed the dissolution of much of the metal; (ii) the difficulty to recycle them, even in non-polar media because of the poisonous adsorption of organic compounds at the catalyst surface. Thus, it appears difficult to carry out the hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes on an industrial scale with this kind of catalyst. Supported homogeneous catalysts based on phosphino-iridium compounds appear more promising. Thus, these catalysts are (i) chemoselective for several unsaturated aldehydes (3-methyl-2-butenal; all-traps-retinal and RHQ; (ii) stereoselective in the case of all-traps-retinal and RHQ; (iii) easy to recover. Although the catalyst recycling has been achieved, in numerous cases, their productivity (10-15 h-1) has to be improved in order to afford a reasonable alternative to unsupported homogeneous catalysis in the hydrogenation of a,ss- unsaturated aldehydes.
